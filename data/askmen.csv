You claim that PC language is 'noise' and that hyperbolic language by the speaker cuts through this noise.

While the audience has some responsibility to attempt to cut through the noise, they are not beholden to the sender to patiently wade through every little bit.

Yes it was cum dumpster. Her last name was Cummuta. 

Explanation time- Look the only reason we called her that wasn't because she was sleeping with a bunch of men and having fun. It was because we learned that she was sleeping with a lot of men to get pregnant so she could get out of the military with an honorable discharge.

To me new years day is the same as Christmas, Easter or any other nationally recognized holiday in that it's just another day with no special meaning.

To most however, there are ~10 days a year where special meaning is ascribed and the other 355 days of the year are... 'normal' (in so far as they aren't special).

What I don't get is the people that treat a new calender day (1^st Jan) as a new start to a year full of potential, but seem unable to maintain that outlook for every day of the year (or for that matter longer than a month).

I would discuss it on or before a  second date ish.  If the underlying reason for it is (for  example) religious, well you probably want  to  discuss that broadly on a first date.  

&gt;I need it to be natural and not awkward.

When you're essentially being randomly hit on that's not going to happen easily, but then you can also be more upfront about rejecting people.  

&gt;I could appreciate any advice on how to approach this subject with guys that I am interested in.

Only discuss  dating in a place where this would commonly accepted practice or where it's explicitly upfront (say online dating where someone searching for you might be deliberately looking for someone who is abstinent until marriage, or in a religious setting where that would be a core component of beliefs). 

&gt;I am a freshman in college

Depending on the college you may find you're in an  extremely small minority (one university I went  to), or part of a sizeable minority (another I  went to).  The  trick  is finding people with similar  expectations.  


Dating is essentially a giant search tree.  The more people you won't be interested in that can be excluded with a question the earlier it should arise.  One starts with the obvious generally - of the 100% of the population that isn't you, you only look for people who are of the correct gender, speak your language, live in your general area, aren't already married, are the right age etc.  Of the dating pool for someone in their late  teens early 20's about 70% of men in the US will have already had sex, and  be expecting to have sex in a relationship, and a significant fraction of the remaining 30% will want to have sex but haven't found anyone willing yet.   If you're in europe or canada it's more like 80/20.  So you really do need to be upfront about it. 

&gt;I am OK with oral sex.

Though in the realm of consolation prizes this seems like a good one.  To some extent that can  complicate your position.  You meet someone  nice, you have oral sex, and you can say that's as far as you'll go, and they don't feel like you've wasted their time.  But it's also not really something you offer after they've said they only want a relationship with someone who will have sex.

I'm not being selfish but when someone brings me along so that I can be DD or so that I'm there to watch coats then I'm not going to become someone's butler. I'd just rather sleep early and go for a run, skateboard, or play disc golf early in the morning and enjoy a new day. And sometimes I make new friends doing one of those things.

Example edit- Last night was one of these times. I had made plans to go out with some friends of mine. It was going to be a huge gathering of people but only four people ""decided"" to show up. I later learned that my ""friend"" wanted me to drive because I didn't have a date and wasn't going to hook up with anyone so I wasn't going to drink. She also made it so that I was to believe she invited a bunch of people who were single, male and female, but in reality she didn't. It was just a facade for me to drive them downtown and drive them back home. When I learned that she didn't invite some of my friends that she said she did then I decided I was going to stay home. So I just stayed home and was on Reddit all night. 

 TL;DR- Friend told me to go out with her and her friends last night but only wanted a ride back home. She said she invited a bunch of people but in reality she invited a couple and her SO.

Sure, the women exposed in that twitter are women you would never have to do anything with, but still...

I started asking my female friends for their opinion, and they all agree that a taller guy is generally best and all of them see being short like a great handicap in the dating world. I've often heard them say ""that guy would be so cute if only he was taller"". 

But what can we do about it? Nothing. Height is something you can't do anything about, besides wearing bigger shoes, so there's no point it being bitter about it. If it was a physical condition that was fixable by diet or exercise, I would be doing that nonstop, but since nothing is going to make me taller, might as well live with it.

I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. You're only 16, you still got plenty of time to grow. Stay healthy and fit, that will compensate for your height. :)",0

There was a study - I'll look for it a bit later - where they showed groups different images of vaginas, and the groups which saw small and surgically altered labia were more likely to rate surgically altered labia as not only what society's expectation was, but also *as normal.* It's another example where statistically and medically normal people feel the need to have surgery just to feel normal, which any mental health person would tell you is bad news.

This guy doesn't sound like long term material, and I wouldn't expect that you can change him. You sound like a concerned girlfriend, and you deserve to be with a guy who can appreciate that.

You can try and change him, try and get him to drink less but he's likely a boy in college who just wants to drink and get laid. He'll likely see it as you holding him back and break it off then get drunk and have sex that same night.

After a ""recent"" breakup, I realized that I need to find myself, I need to become the man I've always wanted to me. And *then* comes a relationship.

My big dream/plan right now is to study abroad in [New Zealand](http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/search?q=new+zealand&amp;restrict_sr=on) (or Australia; still haven't decided) in 2-3 years. This is really big for me, because I'm very, very shy. I find it hard to approach people, to go up to people and talk to them. Being in a new country where I don't know anyone and would need to start from scratch would be a real challenge for me. Putting myself in an unknown place and in a vulnerable situation is my ultimate challenge. I really think it would be an amazing life experience.

However, even though I want to do it, I know that I really need to push myself, because otherwise I'll just end up dropping the dream. I read somewhere that you should share your plans and dreams with people around you, because they'll remind you of your own dreams. They'll push you in the right direction. And perhaps that's why I'm sharing this now..! If you - or anyone - have any tips, I would appreciate it.

I'm slowly working toward that goal. Studying abroad is the ultimate challenge. It represents everything I want to overcome and the person I want to become.

And then I think I'll be happy with myself. *That*'s what I need, because right now I'm in no condition to be in a (healthy) relationship.",0

It will explain a lot about how women and men process the world.  

Once you are in your new city.  Get some practice.  Real life is different than college and so are women's expectations.  By 30 most women are hitting their sexual prime and have no clue how to express that need.  A nice, cute, successful young guy is right up their alley.  Gain some confidence and experience with them.  Who knows? It might lead to a relationship or two.  Just make sure they aren't married and use condoms as they may not be responsible with birth control right now.

Finally, join meet up and get into a few groups.  Enjoy yourself.  Make new friends.  Women will respond, especially if you are a good friend to women you aren't into but are a good friend to.  Women talk, and have a wider variety of associates but few true friends they trust.  Their is no such thing as bad advertisement.  Even a bad date or a bad hook up generates interest as many women are as alone as you are. Soon you will be known as a great guy and women well pursue you.

12846,12846,selsewon,AskMen,1388674111.0,"I believe there are 3 types of people when it comes to relationships.  

1) The lucky.  There are those that find themselves in great, long-lasting relationships from a very young (relatively speaking) age.  This is ultra-rare, even as many relationships on the surface start off blissful but can end in heartbreak.  Heartbreak is more common than love.

2) The settlers.  These are the folks that ""settle"" to make do with what they have found.  Sparks may have not have flown as much as they would have liked, lightning may not have struck them, but they are... content with what they have and may manage to stick it out until the end.  They have settled for what they have, but may silently wonder (for a while or forever) if they could have had something better.  This group of people terrifies the last group, and keeps them there...

3) The dreamers.  I place myself in this group.  I am a 36 y/o m and have been through engagements, heartbreak and heartbreak again, ups, downs, casual, serious - you name it. Everything shy of marriage and divorce basically.  Dreamers believe in something great awaiting them.  Fate, to some I suppose.  And honestly, I don't necessarily preach that ""this"" is the best way to go about it.  Maybe that group of Settlers are the wise once they do not find themselves fortunate enough to be in the group of the Lucky.  I think Settlers can find happiness because they learn to work together over time - and I think some Dreamers unfortunately spend a lot of time alone.  This can drive us mad - but it is WHO WE ARE.

It's okay to want everything in your mate.  Maybe a tad unrealistic, but it is okay to have high expecations.  You are doing what drives you and you feel as if great love is a priority - do not change your desire.

What I would suggest is to shift your own paradigm.  Do not force it, it can lead to frustrations.  Rather, have FAITH that the universe will eventually put you, and your future mate together.  I am an atheist, so I do not preach faith in the Religious sense. Rather, faith that with effort investment of self, you will be placing yourself in the best possible position to find your counterpart.  


TL; DR - It's okay to want the world, just get yourself in the best place possible to attract the best possible mate.",0

This is the most important thing to take away from this excellent post, IMO. 

It's about *them*. This includes being available to them (going out and meeting women), being attractive to them (working out, being important, being confident), and working toward getting to know them (starting a conversation and then not blowing it). 

If a person focuses on themselves all the time, they'll end up a total basket-case, but this is rarely a problem. More often than not people aren't focusing on themselves enough...they blame others for not wanting what little they have to offer, so they end up in a never-ending cycle of bitter and lonely. 

Self improvement can be whatever you want it to be, but self improvement *from a relationship standpoint* is all about having things to offer someone else, whether it be in a home purchase, a job interview, or in dating. Part of that is understanding that no one will know you have anything to offer until you advertise it, and often people will buy-in to the person with the best offer on the table which explains loser dudes with awesome girlfriends.

Improving yourself for yourself, improving yourself for others, improving your situation, improving your communication skills, and improving your ability to advertise yourself to others are all different goals here. When they come together, you are likely to be a very successful, happy person.",0

It means I'm *always* the one doing driving to peoples houses  for christmas/new years/events etc.  And it means basic routine things, going to work, shopping for groceries, shopping for anything necessarily involves me and wastes my time.  

But story time.

My mother worked with this gentleman named Lloyd from when she was 19 to 53.  Lloyd is a nice guy, always was, a big baseball fan.   Lloyd is also married, has been for... uh... at least 35 years if not longer.  His wife didn't drive.  

When Lloyd got to about 63 years old he started to get forgetful.  He forgot how much beer he'd had to drink (or where he'd put the beer, which, was, a least, a self limiting problem).  Then he forgot how to get places.  He's in a home now, and doesn't remember me, my mother or his wife or son.

Suddenly his wife had a  big problem.  She was about 60, never worked, never drove... and needed to learn, fast.  She needed to be able to drive on highways and in big cities to get  to and from  her husband.  It was a nightmare (and a fairly expensive collection  of damage  to various cars because she didn't have any experience to rely on when trying to drive around).  She has to drive now, and in many ways it made her own  life so  much better.  She gets to do whatever everyday and not waste time on  public transit and  that nonsense.  Driving  is part of her independence - which was forced upon her.  

So the TL;DR is that yes it's annoying, depending on where you live it pushes the point of deal  breaker.    But being able to drive is more about your own independence and efficient use of time than  it is about me.  It really does depend where you live though.  ",0

It's exceptionally difficult to be introspective about  whether or  not you are the one being irrational  or he is.  In an ideal world we could all sit down and decide if we were actually the problem and do better  in future.

No, I can do you one better.

It's important if you want to lose weight to have a caloric deficit. Of course as you do this you won't be bulking. Hit the treadmills, and bikes to get some cardio in. Walk and run, mix it up. Hit the weights but do low weight high rep and very little rest. You're going to shed the pounds pretty fast if you couple this with a relatively healthy diet. Honestly, I was eating Mcdonalds and Pizza some nights and still managed to drop weight every week because I put the work in at the gym.

When you want to bulk, more calories and higher weights will do that. You want to slim down a bit first, then put the muscle on. 

If you need any more help, you should check out /r/fitness I've given you the fundamentals to succeed. If you're looking for exact workouts try looking up dumbbell exercises to start. ",0

You're not talking about PC language, you're talking about prevarification and lying for personal gain.

""PC"" language is itself a giant fuck you to anyone who complains about the use of destructive language. People get up in arms about PC language for two reasons. First, some people understand that using different words does not change people's minds a much as you might think. You can't take the racist out of someone by shaming them into not saying the word ""nigger"". Second, the racist/sexist assholes out there hate being told what they really are, and resent people using PC language to clearly identify them.

He'll probably still do his best to make you orgasm, and I don't see that as a bad thing, but he'll know not to blame himself if it doesn't happen.

I don't think it's a big deal.

And I think the best time to bring it up is pretty much as you mention, in response to ""did you come?"".

Bringing it up in advance just makes it sound like a big issue, and then he *will* take it as a challenge (if it's important enough for you to bring it up before/outside sex, he'll assume that it's something that bothers you, and so making you orgasm will become much more important to him.

But I was so oblivious to the signs that I just didn't understand that she was yelling for my attention. We even slept in the same bed and cuddled a bit, which is weird because I hate cuddling. I hate using the word friend zoned but I did it. I just saw her as a friend even though she was very attractive. It's sad because I was one of the few men who didn't use her for sex or abused her both mentally or physically. But after a month of living in my couch she said she was going to go back home. It's sad because a week before she broke the news; I figured it out. But I was on a boat sailing to Alaska and couldn't say anything to her. Then I did it again. I visited her a year ago because I was visiting Arizona. Anyway, we got really hammered and I slept on her bed but before anything happened I passed out. I remember her kissing me.

22841,22841,gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1388761501.0,"&gt;The main theory within the red pill narrative I guess would have to be hypergamy.

While this one definitely applies to some women, it also applies to some men, and certainly does not apply to all women. I've seen a lot of guys on that subreddit make it sound like this is the default setting for all women - that we are, essentially, a pack of gold-digging whores bent on marrying the richest man who will have us, and that our hypergamous drive will eventually kick in and destroy our current relationships if we have not already ""married up"". They take a social theory that has some validity and run wild with it, taking it to an extreme and turning it into misogyny. 

&gt;Other elements I feel are sound are the rationalization of changing feelings based on partner behaviors (i.e. that women's feelings are more about how the man makes her feel than any intrinsic qualities in the man himself)

Again, that has *some* validity. But to say that women in relationships base their feelings on what they get from a man and not on *who he is as a person* is not accurate and just comes off as pure misogyny. As a woman, when I think about my husband and the way I feel about him, my feelings are based on who he is, on the things about him that are wonderful and admirable, and not just on how he fulfills my emotional needs. I know that this does not in any way make me an unusual woman - from what I've seen, this is a completely typical way for people to feel (both men and women) when they're in a happy relationship. They do with this idea what they do with hypergamy - take it to extremes and apply it to all women as if it's just the norm for us to be that entirely self-focused.

&gt;the concept of The Wall (i.e. that many women who have not settled down and had a family realise that they are no longer able to attract men as desirable to them as they were previously able to aka All The Good Men Are Gay Or Taken) 

Now that one does seem to have more merit than the others. There is a lot of pressure for women to put off settling down and having a family until we've played the field and spent a decade focusing on all-important career advancement; by the time you realize you really, really want to get married and have a family, your options have narrowed because a lot of the men you used to be having flings with have settled down and partnered up. I feel so bad for men and women who put it off and put it off, and then one day realize they've waited a bit too long. It was one of the factors that figured into my own choices that I made in my late teens/early 20s. I didn't want to have that regret; I wanted to spend my youth with the man I love and with our children. I was 19 when I got married, 20 when our first child arrived, 21 when we had our second, and 24 when we lost our third. I turn 30 this year and I have absolutely zero regrets about spending my 20s in that manner instead of focusing on a career - the idea of still being single and unattached during this season of my life makes me cold.

&gt;that men can make themselves more desirable as partners by doing things that actually matter to women (and that these are not what conventional wisdom tells men they are)

This one is okay too, although I think they miss the mark with their concepts of what it is that women really want from men. It's true that conventional wisdom often gives men a bum steer where women's wants are concerned. But these guys are even more wrong. They insist that women don't know what they want, because we're just too weak to know our own minds, and are easily confused - *they* know what women want, and that is to be dominated and controlled, to be a man's housekeeper and sex doll who tows the line or gets kicked to the curb. We want to be disciplined and we all want to be with rich men who will spend money on us, and we're all totes willing to trade sex to get it. Yes, that's totally what makes women tick. We loved it so much when it was the norm for us to be treated like second-class citizens that we started the feminist movement and fought to have the right not to have to live under anyone's thumb anymore. 

It's like these guys come *so close* to getting things right, but their sexism and anger get in the way and cloud their vision, so they are always missing the mark and going off on a tangent.",1

I joined wrestling and made it through the year (when the principle and coach had a bet on how long it would take me to quit one or two weeks as we have one of the hardest/best wrestling programs in the state) joined track, became social, became homecoming king, became prom king.

Didn't matter because there was obviously something wrong with me. We always hung out but if I ever said anything she would kind of avoid it. She still asked me to help her with stuff and hang out but if I mentioned I liked her she would say stuff like ""i'm not ready for a relationship right now"" blah blah blah.

Then we went to different colleges and I reverted to before I met her because she was a stabilizing force. I would stutter and throw up and cry whenever someone made eye contact. Then I tried to kill myself got removed from college and now I'm going back...tomorrow.

That said.
In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.
My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.
I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).
I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.
I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.
I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.
I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.

I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.
I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.
The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.
I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.

Neither approach is going to be pleasant for him, but I think if I were the BF, I'd rather have the one honest, direct conversation about the problem, than an endless stream of subtle and not-so-subtle hints that just wear me down and make me feel like crap all the time. Get the talk over with, once and for all, so it becomes a shared project you can both talk about openly, and not just something he feels he's being silently judged for.

Just be there for your girlfriend. Listen to what she has to say. Take care of her before and after. Each woman recovers from an abortion differently. Maybe look into therapy for the both of you if you feel it's needed.  Don't panic if she flip flops between decisions. I did several times as it's a head and heart battle.

Depending on how far she is I recommend for her to try to take a few prenatal vitamins anyway.

You're putting too much emphasis on looks and physical attraction, it's like you think the only way a relationship can work is if you're both good looking.

It's not about you at all. That's where the naive thing comes in. You think because he thinks another girl is attractive you won't be able to hold onto him and that's not correct. 

Relationships are about more than physical attraction, while it is a vital part for **most** people, it's not the entirety of why two people get together. You need to grow up and realize that.

You say 15-18... I don't know what you look like exactly, but I'm going to assume that age-range means post puberty, with clearly defined sexual features and so on. You are short and have a youthful face, and that's pretty much it.

Just be aware any partner you have, especially male partners, might be in trouble if people mistake you for younger than you are, even if they're actually younger than you (say, 20 or something). But that's not anything that can't be clarified through having your ID on you among other things.

Are you in college? If so, the people you meet there will definitely know how old you actually are. And people look differently when you know them.

That whole argument that you're trying to make is based on the fact that a relationship is trying to achieve some sort of ends, which would mean the relationship would come to an end once it fulfills that purpose. But you don't get into a relationship to achieve some sort of ends. Therefore, the first part doesn't apply, so only the second part does.

And I'm going to disagree here.  Of course relationships have ends.  Why get into a relationship if not to achieve something, be it happiness, sex, companionship, children, financial stability, etc. ?  Why do you get into relationships?

&gt;The problem here is that people see ""failure"" as a terrible thing, and are looking to make it sound better. You can twist the way a relationship ended and say that it wasn't a failure, because at least you learned something, but that would still be twisting things just to make them in your favor. You can still fail while learning something and that's okay, so I see no reason to have to do that. I don't see why everyone gets so upset at the word ""failure.""

This is because the relationship is supposed to continuously produce whatever you're looking to get out of it, instead of some final consequence. If it's happiness, the relationship should continue to give you happiness. If it's sex, it should continue to give you sex. By your own definition, once the relationship stops giving you these things, then how has it not failed?

So there's no such thing as a success that isn't permanent?  That's foolish.  Relationships change, and you can't say they've failed if they do.  Sometimes you get more than you planned on.  

&gt;You can have successes and failures at the same time.

It's not that I am biased against that subreddit. But looking at it objectively, it is a hive of misogyny and rage, and that colours all of the advice and ideals and theories they put forth. Even looking at their theories in an unbiased manner, I come to the same conclusion: that they take it too far and and wind up simply spewing sexism. I don't think that what they say are default settings for women ""in general' and that there are ""exceptions"", and I don't feel that way because of bias.

&gt;I think it is more the case that TRP'ers recognise that society pressures women to be seen to adopt certain behaviors and punishes them for not doing so

I don't think so...that's never the way they frame it. They frame it in terms of what women *really* want. And they are also big on slut shaming. Have you never heard any of them talk about the ""cock carousel"" that women ride? These are men who are happy to be the man that a woman's having a one night stand, but they'll turn around and judge her for ""riding the cock carousel"" (never mind that they volunteered to be one of the horses on that merry-go-round...derp!), and deem her no longer fit to date because ""she's too easy"". It's so illogical, but it's also, sadly, quite common there.

&gt;It isn't that women don't know what they want, they often do know what they want but are conditioned (societally) and pressured (socially) not to admit what they want and so sometimes have to come up with convoluted explanations that justify them fulfilling their desires without damaging their sense of worth. I believe that this is what some feminists refer to as an aspect of patriarchy. Regardless of the source, TRP'ers recognise this and have labelled it as hamstering.

That makes sense, and ""hamstering"" is a funny way to put it - it really can feel like you're running for all you're worth and going nowhere fast. There is a lot of pressure on women to be and do certain things; but I think it isn't fair to call it patriarchy, because there's also an awful lot of pressure on men to be and do certain things too. 

&gt;unwillingness to engage in debate.

27883,27883,gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1388796751.0,"&gt;I can't argue with that, but at the same time you need to take into account why there is rage there. If you accept that a lot of people there are there because they've been hurt badly in relationships and are looking for answers, need to vent and are frustrated, angry and betrayed then that goes a long way to explaining what you have highlighted. 

I have long suspected this to be the case for a lot of people who are sexist - they've had bad experiences with the opposite sex, sometimes with people they date and often from seeing one parent screw the other over big time while they were growing up. Sometimes it's because they see a lot of their friends get hurt in their intimate relationships too. I understand the anger; it's just misplaced. They cross the line from being angry at the person who hurt them - or the people who hurt their friends - and apply that behaviour to everyone who is the same gender as the ones they're angry at. 

&gt;These guys aren't sleeping with them, they'd like to be but such girls are too far out of their league. So instead they take solace that when said girls looks start to fade and their partner count means that they aren't sufficiently desirable to any guys they'd be prepared to accept settling down with and eventually turn to these guys that they too would be able to turn down said girls just as said girls turned them down previously

I get that. Sour grapes. They don't generally do a very good job of hiding that.  ; )  A girl is only a slut when she sleeps with everyone but you, as the saying goes.

&gt;Also, there is no logical inconsistency between wanting to have casual relations with girls who are physically attractive and serious relationships with girls that are emotionally attractive.

&gt;Apologies, it seems I wasn't clear. 

No no, you were clear! It just reminded me of all the challenges to debate that I was given. It was seriously amusing.

&gt;I meant that a lot of people are unwilling to debate with RP'ers because the subreddit comes across as so angry.

That's not the only reason...it's also that most people can see their views for what they are, and don't take it seriously. It would be like debating a flat-earther - sure, you could, but what's the point?
There is a huge logical inconsistency between being a man who is having a one night stand with a woman, and then turning around and judging that woman for having a one night stand, or judging women in general for engaging in the selfsame behaviour you just engaged in. It is hypocritical at best.

&gt;I'm sure you've heard the good lock and good key analogy before

I have, and it's bullshit. A good lock is one that only opens for one key; a good key is one that will open any lock. Ugh. Such sexist tripe. It boils down to the same old, tired notion that sex defines a man but defiles a woman. It's crap.

&gt;I won't go into detail about why discerning women are seen as better long-term prospects and undiscerning women are seen as better short-term prospects.

That, I can understand. I was never interested in dating guys that had a lot of *ahem* experience with women. I wanted someone with more conservative views. It's not a problem to want someone who hasn't slept with the entire football team...it's just that when you personally have had a lot of sex and think it's fine, but you refuse to date women who've had a lot of sex because they're not good enough, that's impossible for me to respect because of how contradictory it is, and because of the utter arrogance and blindness to self it displays.",1

I dunno...if they were pissed at a black person for hurting them and they were saying ugly things about black people, would we be so quick to give them a pass and declare that they aren't really racist?

&gt;You and I also seem to disagree about the hypocrisy inherent in judging men and women separately over sexual matters. I suspect this is due to ideological differences but I would hope that you understand enough of my perspective to recognize why I don't believe I am a hypocrite for holding differential standards for men and women even if you disagree with me? 

I don't agree with your opinion, but I respect you because you've been very respectful through this whole thing, and I've enjoyed our discussion.

But I don't agree that it makes sense to judge men and women differently in sexual matters. Sex is sex, and men and women aren't so different from one another that we should be held to different standards where sexual conduct is concerned. Physically women do have a bit more to lose, seeing as we can get pregnant; but birth control is leveling that playing field in a big way, and emotionally we don't really have any more to lose than men do. If having many partners is damaging to a woman, why would it*not* be damaging to a man? Furthermore, if you believe that having many sexual partners damages women, would it not hold true that male sexuality is therefore destructive and harmful in nature, seeing as the vast majority of these women are heterosexual? That's the thing about these views - not only is it sexist against women, by implying that we are somehow the gatekeepers of sexual morality, but it's also sexist against men as it strongly implies that men defile and damage women. I do not approve of double standards...they always exist to give one group an advantage, even if it's only a perceived one, over the other.",1

So you get free replacements and sharpening forever- as in if you use it for like 40 years and hand it down; whoever you give it to gets free sharpening and replacements forever just because you got one off them (you have to pay for shipping if you don't have someone come to you to sharpen it but otherwise it's free) and if you misuse or abuse it you get a replacement for 50% off

Also there's a 15 day trial period after you get it where you can return it and get a refund no questions asked in case you don't find it suits you or you want a different one instead or something

&gt; Have you ever thought your partner was not as beautiful/sexy because of an unflattering sex position?

... no. And I can't imagine ever thinking that.

Turn the tables for a moment. Can you imagine *ever* thinking that your SO isn't as sexy or attractive anymore, because of what he looked like at one particular moment, in one position during sex?

I hope not.

And honestly, if you're in a long term relationship, then he knows perfectly well what your body looks like. An ""unflattering angle"" isn't going to come as a shock to him, it isn't going to make him suddenly realize that you look like a troll. He sees you, no matter the angle. There's no such thing as ""unflattering"". If he thinks you're beautiful, then he'll keep thinking you're beautiful no matter your pose or the angle he sees you from.

You can worry about something looking unflattering when that is *all* someone sees of you (say, if you send someone a picture of yourself, and that is all they've ever seen of you, or if you're on the cover of a magazine, or whatever). Then that ""unflattering"" image will be how they perceive you. But when you know someone and you know what they look like, you don't really notice individual ""bad"" angles or poses any more.

At the end of the day professional help needs to be the first bit of advice you get.  I know you've said it's not something you can access at the moment, but really do make sure you've searched every corner for an affordable/free option before you give up, and if your circumstances do change in the future then continue to seek out that help.  This goes double if you're self-diagnosed - there may be more/other things going on that a professional can help you to understand as well.

That being said the next three important things are a support network, diet and exercise.

Any support network is better than nothing.  Others have suggested relevant subreddits to look into, which is great because they are easily accessible.  Having someone face to face is probably better if you can make it happen - do have a look for local support groups, community groups, social meetups.

There is, as the professionals say, a ""growing body of evidence"" linking diet, exercise and mental health.  Again, this isn't a substitute for other treatments recommended by a doctor, but it is something you can start working on now.  There will always be people trying to sell you on extreme regimes, but by and large these very specific schemes haven't been shown to have more benefit than a balanced diet and plain old light exercise.  You may be able to combine this with the above by looking for local casual sporting teams to join.

Finally, your expectations.  I've heard it said that when you're sick it usually takes about the same time to ""get better"" as it did to become unwell.  You've not said how long ago this abuse occurred but it's clear that this is something which has developed for you over many years.  Even with the best circumstances it is likely to take time, work and patience with yourself before things improve.  Remember this when you get discouraged.

35278,35278,gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1388867073.0,"Here's the thing...you said that there is a correlation that exists for women but does not exist for men. These studies don't say that.

The first study says this in conclusion: ""This study established a strong association between number of sex partners and later substance disorder, especially for women, which persisted beyond prior substance use and mental health problems more generally."" See where it says ""especially for women""? That is the clincher. This sentence means that there is a strong association between number of sex partners and substance abuse *for men as well as women*. It happens more with women, but it happens for men too. You say that there is no correlating damage for men, but this study says otherwise. The fact that it happens more to women doesn't mean you get to totally ignore the fact that it also happens to men.

Second link: ""As the number of reported alcohol-related behaviors increased, the adjusted proportion of respondents who had recently had multiple partners rose from 8% to 48% among females and from 23% to 61% among men."" Wait a sec - this isn't what you thought it was! ""The proportion who had had multiple partners in the past three months increased from 7% among currently sexually active females who reported no alcohol-related behaviors to 61% among those who reported all five behaviors; among males, these proportions were 28% and 65%, respectively."" This study shows that guys who drink have more sexual partners than girls who drink. It also showed that men are more promiscuous than women overall, and that they start having sex younger. This study doesn't show that sex damages people - this one is about the effects of alcohol on the number of sexual partners, and it appears that women have fewer sex partners than men when alcohol is involved. It even showed that the more sex partners guys have, the less likely they are to use condoms. You have to read to the bottom to see that data, but it's there. The study concludes with this: ""Our data show both similarities and differences in numbers of sexual partners by gender. Adolescent males were more likely than females to report multiple partners, both in the past three months and over their lifetime. Sexually experienced males were also more likely to report having had no partners in the previous three months. These patterns suggest fundamental differences in the stability of relationships for males and females, and may reflect different approaches to experiencing and understanding sexual relationships. Despite these differences, similar sets of risk factors were associated with multiple partners among males and females."" Read that last sentence again.  : )

The third study, on marriage and cohabitation and divorce, was only performed on women. No men were studied to determine whether this was something that happened to them too. Right off the bat that makes me suspicious of your use of this study as ""proof"". Until and unless I see a corresponding study performed on men proving that premarital sex and cohabitation have no effect on the success of men's marriages, I'm not going to regard this study as having any bearing on this discussion because it's entirely one-sided.

The fourth study is not something I'm able to read; you have to pay $12 to do so and that's not happening. It does not, however, indicate in the little blurb about the article that sex damages women but does not damage men. It appears that this is not a study about sex doing psychological damage, but rather, a study regarding what sort of psychological differences exist between the genders with regards to selecting a mate. That's kinda not really what you and I have been discussing.

The fifth study is about domestic violence. It has nothing to do with the topic at hand, however, I'm going to save it because it'll come in handy during discussions of domestic abuse...people always claim that almost all victims are women and almost all abusers are men, and that's just not true. Having this to show as evidence will be useful.

The sixth study looks intriguing; I wish I could read the whole thing. However, again, it doesn't appear to shore up your argument that having sex with lots of men is harmful to women and not to men. It is a study about the factors that lead to divorce, which it lists as: age at marriage, education, premarital births and conception, religion, parental divorce, and race. Not gender. It does not in any way seem to indicate that this is a study proving that having multiple partners harms women but not men. It isn't about that.

It sounds like he took you to a place he really likes, but got nervous in the moment. Most likely he is not responding positively because he's subconsciously afraid of opening himself up and potentially messing up/getting rejected.

If he didn't like you he wouldn't initiate at all, he wouldn't respond much, and his face and tone would likely show that he wasn't interested. If you're happy to initiate and can let him know you'd like him to do the same, then I bet you'll both end up happy :)

Men are indeed affected by the number of sexual partners although not to the extent that women are as the first study points out.

I think we agree more than disagree. I don't think either of us believes that having lots of partners is a-okay and won't leave you with baggage, not really. I've always thought it's a bad idea and people are, *in general*, better off if they're more selective and have relationships instead of one nighters. My objection wasn't so much with the idea that promiscuity is unhealthy; it was simply the double standard and its various logical gaps. I don't think that having a lot of sex defiles people or makes them bad or immoral or no longer dateable...but it does seem to be true that having partner after partner after partner, particularly if it's all FWBs and casual stuff, leaves people a little jaded. And again, it was mainly the idea that this only happens to ladies and never to men. 

&gt;The third study is actually one of the most interesting and one I'd come across before, although I understand your scepticism. The guy that did it, Jay Teachman, focuses on the lives of military men but this study was about their spouses.

It's not that I doubt his findings...it's just that, because men were not studied in the same light, it's hard to determine whether his results would be found in only women, or more often in women, or whether you'd find similar or the same results in men. It'd be neat to see a corresponding study performed on the same demographics of men.

&gt;Some very interesting findings that stemmed some pretty immediate counter-research by feminists looking to debunk the findings (and partially doing so by identifying religiosity as a factor IIRC).

I am always super suspicious of feminist-funded studies! It's one thing to perform a study because you have a hypothesis you are trying to either prove or disprove...it's totally another to perform a study because you are motivated by an ideology and another study pissed you off because of your beliefs. 

I'm going to read the links  you sent me a bit later...got a busy evening full of turkey coming up and I want to take my time with it. Anyway, this has been a really enjoyable discussion - and yeah, if you find more stuff, bring it! I'd be interested in seeing it. ",1

There are times where you feel absolutely fine and then all of a sudden it hits you. You feel like absolute shit, you don't want to get out of bed, you lose all motivation and and interest in things that you love doing, there are times when you do feel down, but most of the time you feel just empty inside. These feelings can go on for sometimes days, where it gets to the point where you feel sick of feeling this way, which only makes you feel worse.





Me personally, while I have never had suicidal thoughts, I have come close. My rock bottom was when I was out shopping with my sister, I was in great form when just like *that* it hit me like a wave, I felt horrible, at that time I wished that the ground would just open up and swallow me whole.


As for things to do to get him to smile, just keep doing what you're doing, you have a good sense of humor and that will definitely lift his spirits, as well as any activities you can do as a couple. Other things that are proven to alleviate depression is **exercise, exercise and more exercise**, 3/4 days a week your SO should go for runs, swimming, gym and take up a team sport, not only will he get in better shape it will also boost his serotonin levels (serotonin influences mood and low serotonin levels are linked to Depression), so your SO doesn't feel like he is going through it alone you should also think about doing some of these activities with him so he has someone to relate to and you can grow as a couple. I also recommend he takes up some sort of a hobby, it can be anything as long is it keeps his mind occupied.

You people have it all wrong.

Depression isn't about feeling sad.

It is a lowered (depressed) ability to function. Many times caused by overload of worry and strife.

It loads even more burden on the depressed person to do clown faces and urge them to smile and cheer you up about the situation.

Depression means being unable to complete complicated thoughts, unable to concentrate, forgetting almost instantly what you are about to do.

That makes a person sad.

So - I recommend something more useful. Relaxation therapy. Help him destress with a home spa treatment.

A little exercise and fitness also helps elevate mood. Get outside and feed the homeless or some other fun thing like shoveling snow, making snow men and snow fights and stuff.

That is unless he can also feel guilty about wasting time having fun instead of working

Because hooking up is fun, presumably you've been willing at the time and ok with it afterwards thereby not creating a reason to avoid it.

That's about all we can really say based on the information.  He's just as likely to be trying to keep that intimate vibe in case the day comes that you do move to the same city, as he is to be happy making out with someone he's close to but only gets together with from time to time.

&gt; Do I just need to suck it up and admit to myself that this is purely a friends-with-(some) benefits situation that will never go any further?

One, we knew we both liked each other, we actually talked about it one night, but things moved painfully slow.  I think it took another couple of months before we moved to the next step.  The complicated thing was dating, we already ate dinner and went out all the time, it was hard to bridge the gap between ""this is friendly"" and ""this is a date"".

Ultimately, we finally kissed while watching a movie at home.  Where we couldnt bridge the gap by going out on dates, we did bridge the gap being alone at home and cuddling, getting to close each other. 

The other girl is now my wife.  We were friends for a few months, we talked and texted all the time, we ate dinners.  I kinda had a feeling she liked me but wasnt 100% sure.  

Ultimately she went out on a date with another guy.  I was a lil depressed at this and ended up going out with one my exes.  I ended up getting texts from my friend, her date had gotten her drunk and she wanted me to come get her.  I left my ex at the bar and went to where my friend was.  We talked, we danced (drunkenly), she karaoked.  She ended up walking up to me after she sang a song, and giving me that look.  I ended up kissing her.

When most people have minor disputes they will be direct about it and things will actually be dealt with but an annoyingly significant proportion of women will not, they'll try to deal with things by referring to it without any actual confrontation which can often result in a situation escalating as their message never gets across. When men behave this way other people, as there is no stigma against a woman for calling out a man on something, will call them on it and ensure that they know it isn't going to get the point across, that one can state that they have a problem with something without creating issues. When women behave this way nobody calls them out on it, men often feel that we can't (societal stigma and all that) yet women (who often complain about others acting this way) rarely explain to these individuals why what they're doing is idiotic. Most of the time when women act like this it's because they want to appear a certain way (often simply a subconscious need to do so) which results in them doing things that they don't want to or being ""friends"" with people they hate, plenty of women complain about this happening yet seem unwilling to change themselves or confront those that do this.",0

39578,39578,Not_Han_Solo,AskMen,1388898359.0,"Okay, this is coming from a guy who has, and has in the past, struggled with depression.

Humor/laughter is not a cure for depression.  Many people with no first-hand experience with depression don't understand, and think it's a state of sadness which is, by its nature, opposite to happiness.  They think that laughter is the apex point of happiness, and that depression is the nadir point of sadness.  **This is not true**.  In point of fact, trying to force laughter can make a person's depression worse because it throws the perceived wretchedness of their life into a more stark contrast, the way that a little dash of a contrasting color in the shaded area of a painting can make the colors 'pop'.  It puts the pressure, the burden, of being happy--a state which is or can be a nigh-impossibility for a depressed person--increase upon the depressed individual.  *We're supposed to be happy.  We're not.  We've failed at that too.  God, what a wretched excuse for a human being we are.*  This is, more or less, the thought process.

As others have noted, depression results when the pressures of life become insurmountable, when stress is overwhelming, or when worry is incapacitating.  If you want to help your boyfriend, you need to understand the source of his depression.  Once you do, **help him**.  Not in the ""I'm here for you, honey"" way--in the pick up a tool and help him with his tasks or stressors way.  You don't ask him.  You don't stop when he complains.  You get your hands dirty and with the sweat of your brow and the tears from your eyes show him that he is not alone.  

Being depressed is like being utterly alone in an uncaring world which exists only to destroy you, to grind you into dust, and to celebrate your utter annihilation.  It is the product of environment, and must be dealt with as such.  More than anything, though, there's nothing that says, as powerfully or as indisputibly, that the black heart of depression, that sense of utter isolation, is false than the unflagging presence of a loved one, right there helping.

In many ways, it's a lot like the climax of *What Dreams May Come*, where Robin Williams' character gives up on everything to spend an eternity in mindless torture alongside his wife rather than leaving her to suffer that torment alone.

As Allie puts it: ""And that's the most frustrating thing about depression. It isn't always something you can fight back against with hope. It isn't even something — it's nothing. And you can't combat nothing. You can't fill it up. You can't cover it. It's just there, pulling the meaning out of everything. That being the case, all the hopeful, proactive solutions start to sound completely insane in contrast to the scope of the problem.

39597,39597,CrazyPlato,AskMen,1388898517.0,"First off, you're 17. Of course you aren't going to be attracted to women in their 40s. When the age difference is less then twenty years from you, they'll start to be more interesting. In fact, as you get older, you'll learn that counting years becomes pretty impractical: in high school you can tell what year someone is in just by looking at them, but the more years you get under your belt, the more ages start to blend together.

Secondly, I'm betting you won't have to worry nearly as much about aging as you think, because I assume you're male by posting here. Women tend to worry about age, because most beauty traits that they are taught to value are elements of youth. Guys can get older, and the traits we value for attractiveness aren't affected int he same way. It's the reason so many ""attractive"" celebrities are older men: the views we share about ""silver foxes"" are way different than those we share about ""cougars"".

And of course, there's the fact that beauty and attractiveness are more than physical features. A guy with a good personality can overcome a lot of features that aren't textbook sexy.

Girls are a lot closer emotionally as friends than guys are. They talk about everything, nothing is off limits with a very close group of girl friends. So this leads to us just checking in with each other a lot, like ""hey are you going to the party?"" ""yah, what are you wearing?"" it's important not to be too overdressed or underdressed and obviously there's power in numbers so if you're both overdressed, it's okay.

In addition, it's like a security blanket thing. If I show up at a party alone, I'm alone and that can be scary if you don't know anyone there before your friends show up. Plus you know all your closest friends are going to show up together without you if you opt to go alone.

If I show up with all my closest friends, I feel more confident and I've got built in people to talk to if I'm too shy to talk to anyone else. And built in people to protect me if a guy is being scary. (I know most guys are not like this at parties, it's just a constant fear.

I was hoping for more of the actively hating people but still acting friendly with them sort of passive aggressiveness, that's the mindset I can't figure out.

I've had some interesting relationships with people like you, they're usually able to be direct with me because they find they need to be at some point to get a point across and I respond so well to them being direct that they continue to be. I've honestly never had anybody like you dislike me in the least (at least as far as I know), then again I've worked hard to ensure that I am generally held in good regard and that those who dislike me do so without reason at least in person. I've known enough to figure out the thought process well enough. Some are scared of confrontation, they simply can't handle it so they do all the can to avoid it. Some are simply submissive and have difficulty standing up to others, even when they wouldn't be their mind twists it into a confrontation. Some know that they have no idea how to confront others without making people dislike them to some degree. The differences are rather interesting, for example the submissive ones typically project (it's hard to explain, it's part of the reason why I try to figure people out) less than most people while the ones that can't handle confrontation project more but that's to be expected since they're so easily scared.

I understand the whole venting thing, I'm used to be vented to. I don't particularly like it and I usually offer suggestions of how to fix things, the most common is to ignore the person with some sort of reasoning (I know when to give a real solution and when to give a pep talky one, the latter works really well when it's just a sit there and listen to me vent because it both helps solve the problem and shows that you were listening), and they both go over well and usually work because I tailor them to the individual. Then again I usually walk right into it, I may pick my friends based on them not projecting much but sometimes being around them is messing with me more than it should (it usually manifest with a specific headache in addition to everything else) and I know they have a problem that needs dealing with, I ask them if something is wrong, they say yes, I ask if they want to talk about it, they vent, catharsis is had, I don't need to fight my own brain as much and probably won't even approach my limit. Getting pushed past my limit isn't fun, there's a reason why I avoid parties.

Why? Because the let's say 20% chance that I was wrong was enough to make me hesitate. Friends would say ""Just try it, if it doesn't work out, you'll date other girls."" But I wasn't interested in the abstract notion of ""dating"" or ""girls"" - I wanted to be with that one girl, that *person*, spend time with her, talk, and so on. The moment you make a move, there's a risk of breaking that and that risk often felt too big to take. Eventually things would mostly fall into place, and I can say today that I do not regret a single relationship I had in my life, because every time I had gotten to know and enjoy the person before going further. Nothing to do with abstinence, just plain romanticism.

Maybe see it the other way round: there's a guy who's willing to spend time with you and not just get in your pants. And yeah, he very, very probably likes you, but on top of that respects you. That's pretty nice. If you want to speed things up, just take his hand and you'll know.",0

Any other life changes that could have affected him more than you realize? That part immediately stuck out to me, and no one else seems to have brought it up. A few years ago, he changed. Why? what else happened around that time?

A lot of what you're saying describes me at that age fairly well too (except for the kyphoscoliosis, the anger and hitting anyone. I just kept to myself)

I'm still slowly untangling what caused me to curl in on myself like that, but two factors I am aware of are that

- a couple of years before, my parents divorced (it was a perfectly peaceful and friendly thing, they were, and still are, on good terms, so for the longest time I completely dismissed this as having affected me negatively at all. But it was still a major change in my life, and the timing fits)
- after the divorce, my mom moved out of town, and I moved in with my dad and my stepmom, whom I couldn't stand. Long story short, they didn't make room for me in any way (physically, I got a tiny room that doubled as their home office and general storage room, and mentally I just always felt more like a guest (or sometimes a guest worker) than someone who actually had his home there.)

I never had friends visiting me either (and I didn't make as many, or as close, friendships as I had earlier either), I didn't get a girlfriend, I spent most of my time either playing video games or just out/away from everyone. And I didn't interact much with my dad at all either.

I'm still struggling with the fallout from all of this though. I didn't get a girlfriend until my mid/ate 20's, and while I get along well with almost everyone, I rarely make friends with anyone.

As for actual advice? No clue, really.
Well, some of it is just general teenage behavior, I guess.
But as some others have said, be a parent, not a friend. Don't ""joke"" about taking away his computer. Either do it or don't do it. And don't *ever* let him slap you (I'm not saying reciprocate with violence either, but you're his mom, you should have the authority to tell him that that just *does not happen*. And this might be a cultural thing, but sheesh, why are you doing everything in the house? Why don't you make him cook a day or two every week?

But none of that has much to do with the real issue, I think. If you can get him to see a therapist, that might be a good idea. But teenagers are hard to deal with at the best of times. It is entirely possible that you will just have to ride it out, and then help him fix it later, when he is older.",0

Or to put it another way, when it rains it pours.

I've had periods in my life when I went straight from a relationship to having an fwb and somewhat regular one night stands and I've periods where I went months between every time.

And obviously how much effort you put into getting laid affects this as well, if I put almost zero effort into it then I'm lucky to get laid every few months but if I'm actively out pursuing women every weekend then chances are I'm having a one night stand every couple of weeks or so (though the latter approach is pretty tiresome after a while, at least from my perspective as a guy since the expectation in a bar/club environment is for the guy to make the first move).

You should also keep in mind that people who aren't having sex rarely talk all that much about it, so even though your buddy has only had three one night stands in the last four months the only mentions of sex you've heard from him are when he just had sex, he probably won't randomly tell you how he's not gotten laid in two months.",0

Talk to him about that in a non-judgmental way so that you can understand why he's hurting.  More, *you* need to understand that his depression won't go away until that rot cause is dealt with.

Then, you need to do your best to be there, with him, helping and suffering alongside him whenever and wherever the sources of his depression are troubling him.  Don't ask for permission here, because he'll try to push you away, in an effort to preserve your well-being.

And he'll be right.  Diving into that pit of despair along with him is going to hurt you.  It's going to be terrifically hard on your relationship.  But, in a very real way, it's the only way that a person can be pulled out of a depression, and the act of being there,of suffering with him because you choose to, is powerful.

**DISCLAIMER:** There's a lot more to my case than ""just"" depression, but since I'm going to talk mostly about the general process of psychiatric treatment I feel that my perspective is still useful.

In regards to the ""feeling numb"" thing:

That's not the desired effect! Many people get that feeling from **some** of the anti-depressive meds (the anti-psychotic pretty much all have this effect and it is often considered ""desired"" because the alternative is, in many cases, way way worse), and that should usually mean that those specific pills are not suited for long term treatment, as very few people can stomach living like that for prolonged periods of time. The good bit is that there are **vast** amount of different meds and they all work a little differently. Everyone is different, and psychiatry is very much a ""we know this *might* work, but we can not know for sure until we try""-thing. No pill works exactly the same on two different people and you need to try different drugs until you find one that works for you.

It can be a pretty arduous process to figure out how the different meds effect you, because it takes roughly 3 weeks before the desired effect actually set in and the initial side-effect wear off. All the meds have side effects, but what you experience in the first three'ish weeks is **not** representative of how it will be in the long run. 

So that's three weeks just to get into a new drug. Then three weeks to up the dosage (a initial doses are usually not high enough). Then perhaps another three weeks for one more adjustment. And then it might not even work well enough to justify the side-effect (this is always a needed consideration. There are **always** side-effects, so you need to weigh whether the good you get from the pill are worth the bad) and you'll have to gradually get out of those meds and then start all o0ver with another product. It takes fucking **ages**, and you feel like shit most of the time during the process.

But there is most certainly something to be gained from it. If you find the right meds, that help you in the way you need without crippling important parts of your life, then it can be, completely literally, a life-saver. I've been in the psychiatric system for near fifteen years now (with several long duration stays at both open and closed psych wards) and my experience, along with that of most people I've gotten to know during those years) is that it **is** worth it in the end.

I have **plenty** bad things to say about that system but in spite of all the problems I have both seen and felt how significant *proper* treatment can be.

I know all too well how hard a process it is. I've been the one to find three different friends after they killed themselves (spent a lot of year living in supervised housing project for nutcases like myself) because they couldn't take it any longer, but I've **also** seen so many others return to the light and reclaim their place in the world despite seemingly impossible challenges. It is worth it to fight; it really really is. Giving up is what eventually will make you off yourself. Don't fucking give up.

PS: Also, exercise is a fucking life-saver. There is simply no way to overstate how much it helps. 

PPS: Getting a blood test done to look for D vitamin defiency is also a good idea here in the winter season. Supplemental vitamin D can help a lot if you're one of the people the suffer from a deficiency. 

PPPS: The single most important part is finding a good psychiatrist. Crappy ones will insist on always pumping the same drug into everyone and refuse to try other approaches and types because they're either taking money from that company or are just incompetent or lazy. A good one will take part in evaluating every single fucking step of the way and will *never* be afraid of adjusting dosages or trying other solutions if the current treatment is not working optimally.

I'm diagnosed with [SPD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder) and an unspecified severe sleeping disorder (they've given up on the last bit after looking for a fitting label for 15 years), so my problems are in a pretty different direction :)

But he should absolutely know that the emotional numbness from the anti-depressants is not the intended effect and is not something that happens with all of them. I've been on some that had that effect on me and for a long while I thought that was just how it was. Then, because of other side effects, I was switched a another drug that *didn't* have that effect on me. Imagine my surprise! :D

It sounds like he's dealing pretty well with his situation. My advice would be to focus less on ""cheering him up"" and more on make sure that he knows you still like him, respect him and care about him even when he's down. Things can get pretty dark in a depression and attempt to ""distract"" can often feel as a lack of respect for how bad you're feeling. I've adopted a ""I can see you feel like shit. That's absolutely ok! I still like you and and respect you and if you want or need my help with anything to get through this a little easier then you need just call""-approach when people near me are tackled by the brain.

As far as exercise go, it's mainly the standard cardio stuff that helps. Lifting is never a bad thing, of course, but it doesn't provide as tangible results for me as, say, running. I don't have any hard numbers to back this up (although I've read several articles that discussed the positive impact of exercise on treatment, as well as prevention, of depression), so I can just speak from my own perspective. 

I'm at ""my best"" when I run daily. Doesn't have to be long trips or anything; any distance from 3km and up will do it for me. That is my optimal case. I can get by almost as well with two-three runs a week, and I can ""survive"" with a single trip a week if it's not for a prolonged period. It should, however, be noted that I'm medicated with very low doses exactly *because* I prefer to handle most of the ""treatment"" through exercise, so that is absolutely a factor in how quickly I become mentally scrawny if I don't keep it up.

A few miscellaneous suggestions to how you can support him when things get rough:

(This is not objective on any way; It's simply things that I have personally experienced helping me when I'm struggling with depression)

- Go shopping for him. It can help a lot to have a filled fridge and not have to worry about getting proper food. You can simply ask if it'd be a help if you brought some groceries by and the left again. Often you'd love to see a friendly face but you're unable to handle actually talking to other people.

- Offer to take care of whatever pressing ""adult"" business there might be piling up. It can be paying bills (of course not with your own money, just the act of actually getting it done), opening mail, calling in sick, rescheduling an appointment, and so on. These things tend to become massive hurdles when you're depressed.

- Offer to help doing random stuff. Not do it *for* him, but *with* him. Cleaning your place can seem like an insurmountable task when you're down, but doing it together with another person while listening to some music or something, can make it a lot easier.

- Offer to do things with him and make sure he knows that you're aware that his energy reserves are limited. ""I know you feel like shit and don't have much energy, so when/if you run out and need to kick me out, just give the word. I'm expecting it and I'm 100% ok with it"". Note that this one should only be done if you are *actually* ok with him suddenly going ""Shit, I'm spent. I need to go lock myself in my bedroom and stare at a wall for 12 hours straight"" :)

Finally: Massive props to your for your approach to this. You're going about it in a very healthy and positive way. These are *his* problems and that will never change. You can not solve them for him; but you **can** help make it a bit easier and a bit less painful :)

PS: To answer your specific question. I have never ""recovered"". What is ""wrong"" with me can not be cured. I'm simply slightly different from the majority of humans. But I *have* learned an amazing amount about where my brain is different and how to create a positive and constructive life in spite of these differences. I'll never be ""normal"", in any stretch of the word, but I've learned to be happy. And that is a fuckload more than I thought possible fifteen years ago :)",0

I start on the treadmill each day walking and running for about an hour and a half. After that I focus on one or two muscle groups that will not conflict with each other. This way on the next day if I'm sore I can workout another muscle group and give my sore ones a rest. I personally choose to do shoulders alone but some people like to do them with arms.

As for ""arms"" I also separate those into two days. Bicep and Tricep. I've been doing Bi/Chest for a while and love the mixup, alternatively I do Tri/Back on a different day. Sometimes if my back or chest is too sore I'll do Bi or Tri with calves. 

Personally I like to leave leg day to itself, as many others do as well. Some hate leg day but I love it. I have very strong legs so it's an easy day and I get a lot done. I also work on forearms on leg day sometimes too.

Rest day I just make sure my activity is light, I may even still go to the gym, walk a mile and go home. If it's nice out I'll usually go throw a football around for a couple hours. Just don't let yourself be stiff and idle.

A lot of people allow them self a cheat day but I figure what's the point? I'll end up working it off tomorrow and really not be ahead. Instead I go by a strict..ish diet. I eat well for the most part and 99% of the time I drink bottled water, though Ive done that for like 6 or 7 years. The odd time I'll have a can of pop or iced tea. I've had pizza and mcdonalds and wings and I still continue to lose weight and stay on track. My theory on this is I'm not stressing myself out saying I have to eat bland veggies, skinless boneless chicken, and whole wheat every day so I stay on track. I just make sure to stay within my caloric limit each day and I keep moving forward.

That's not to say don't eat chicken veggies and whole wheat, it is good for you and I do eat that 80% of the time. Literally half my plate every night is veggies, though I absolutely love them so it's no big deal for me.

My philosophy for all of this is do it right and work your ass off but remember its a lifestyle change. Realistically you're going to mess up sometimes and you're going to want to pig out on a bag of chips but it's all about living better and healthier and being the best you that you can be. You'll stick with it if you remember this. You won't see results every day, and don't weigh yourself every day. I do it Mondays and Thursdays.

Find some workouts that you can do as a starter it's important to not rush out of the gate, it's a marathon not a sprint. Track your progress and stay within your limits. I started out 8 months ago doing 10 minutes on the treadmill and being exhausted now I go 90 and always want more.

This, on top of the problem of actually noticing when you're depressed (it usually happens gradually) can too often mean that there's been significant impact to social life and general situation before the treatment has a chance to do anything.

I know a few people that only take them during the winter half of the year, but that is only really useful if winter is a certain, and the only, cause of depression. 

But I would still advice asking a good psychiatrist about it. They have access to all the research and all the book, on top of a ton of experience, and will be much better suited to judge whether or not on/off medication might be a good idea. It's really important to remember that, at its best, psychiatry is all about adapting to the unique case of the individual patient and his/her needs.

And yea, those side-effects are among the more common ones. But again, those also differ from drug to drug. There are almost always *some* side-effects, but some of them are not too hard to deal with and hell, some are even wanted by some people. I was on some once that made it a lot harder for me to get off. I still could, but it took like three times as long. If that was something I'd had troubles with then that'd be a pretty nifty side-effect :)

And worth noting again is that the effects during the first three to four week are **not** representative for long-term treatment. The vast majority of those will either go away completely or become a lot less severe. The hardest part of getting into medication is to not panic during that initial period. It's so fucking easy to go ""oh hell no, this shit fucks me waaaay to much up!"", and then stop taking it, weeks before the drugs has had a chance to show its positive effects and the bad things to subside or tone down.

I do not suggest that everyone with depression is better off taking meds. I'm actually a firm advocate of avoiding them if possible. But it should be for the right reasons. It's counter-productive to avoid them out of fear or lack of knowledge. They're not always a good fit, but they *can* help immensely and in a great many cases it'd be a good idea to at least give a few different products a fair shake. If they turn out to not be worth it then you can always phase them out again. Sure, it's a fucking hassle, but for the potential benefit I honestly think it's worth the fight.

And yea, an exercise bike or a treadmill will work just fine.

My brother and mother are both CCRNs, so I can actually talk about a lot of this.  Burnout is a very real phenomenon among nurses of all stripes, and its causes are myriad.  12 hour days are a frequent source; while many love the 3 on 4 off schedule, plenty of others simply can't handle the super-long days.  More common is the constant pressure of being responsible, on a daily basis, for the very survival of a number of other human beings.  If I knew his specialty, I could speak more specifically here, but the certain knowledge that any one of your daily activities, at the wrong moment or in the wrong way, can be an inescapable source of stress for some.  It could simply be that he's a guy; while men are nterring nursing more and more, it's still very much a woman's world right now, and if he's the only guy on his floor, trying to fit in could be a really major problem.

But it may well be that his job is only exacerbating the underlying causes of his depression.  For instance, I have a job that I love, but it pays me very, very little.  As a result, I'm constantly cash-strapped and stressed; my job seems to be the proximal cause, but it's only the more obvious suspect, not the real one.  My problem has many solutions which has nothing to do with me getting a new job.  Your boyfriend's situation may be similar.

Figure out, with him, what he loves.  What makes him feel good, strong, smart, worthwhile.  Those are his touchstones, the bases around which he can build a recovery.  Then find the sources of his sadness.  Work to mitigate or minimize them.

Depression is indeed a chemical imbalance in the brain, but you need to remember that it's a persistent chemical state brought on by persistent environmental factors.  Your brain behaves in a certain way when you feel down; depression is simply the result of what happens when your brain becomes accustomed to that norm, and emits hormones and such as though it were the way things were supposed to be.  Recovering from depressions demands that a new norm be established again.",0

They try to break you so that they can reshape you. They take a healthy and happy child, one that doesn't quite fit the norm because their brain is wired differently, and try to make them the perfect example of what a child should be. They tell you that your senses, the way you deal with stress, the way you show joy, the things that cause you pain, the things that calm you are wrong, that they don't, that how you feel doesn't matter because others think differently. Can you justify forcing a child, a six year old kid, who can't make eye contact for long because it causes them physical pain to do exactly that, Yelling at them when they won't look at you, grabbing their head and holding their eyes open?

* Accept the way he feels. When he's not enjoying time with his friends or you, or whatever, don't pressure him into feeling better, in fact, I wouldn't even *try* to make him feel better by ""increasing the fun"" or whatever. I far prefer the attitude ""It's too bad you're not feeling well, but that's okay. I'll just hold you, knowing that that won't fix things, but maybe it'll ease it for the moment.""

* The best thing you can do for him is making sure he's getting the best treatment he can, which should be psychotherapy (talking) or medication or both — depending on which seems most promising for his situation and symptoms. All of this means setting up appointments and actually showing up etc., which can be *really* hard for a variety of reasons. Support him in that in whichever way you can (encouraging alone can make the critical difference).

* Lastly, I guess this is a personal preference, but don't be too in-your-face all day every day. Not ""tell me when you need me"", either: he might not, out of fear of being a burden. Find a middle ground. Or maybe you already know what level of attention he likes. Go with that and display clear intent to help, but don't overdo it.",0

Well yeah. But I think they're aiming their anger at the wrong people.

&gt; I can understand not wanting to be the object of a fetish...I'd rather be with someone who is interested in me and not just turned on by my feet, you know?

As someone with a slightly alarming list of fetishes, I think you have some misconceptions about them. 

I mean, I like sadomasochistically inclined guys, but that doesn't mean I'm some kind of sociopath that can't understand or appreciate or be turned on by anything else about him. I will still love him for his personality, his looks, his mannerisms, et cetera. (This isn't the best example but I'd rather not have to blunder my way through explaining the more fitting but odder ones.) 

It's TOTALLY understandable not wanting to be loved in that *manner*(e.g., with the dude having a larger focus on your feet) and preferring conventional stuff, but it's untrue that the person with the fetish isn't looking at you like a whole human being, like you're a piece of meat.

I will concede that yes, it would probably be very hard to make a relationship with a person with fetishes so absolute that they aren't turned on by anything else. Don't have a problem with that.

There's all sorts of sociological reasons but in general people are more willing to simply distance themselves from such an individual and nobody likes to be alone, they learn to not seek out conflict. Women like that tend not to get distanced and thus they are able to continue to seek out conflict, they don't have that impetus to change the way they act. I want to understand what goes on in their minds to support that.

Honestly I've seen it more in women that always appear happy, they just sort of give off an air of hostility and anger. There aren't many of them but it's kind of clear, just as it's clear when somebody's always looking for a fight or an argument.

There are differences between people but the same general behavior tends to be rooted in specific traits, those traits can differ between the sexes because cultural expectations are different. I make use of knowledge of individuals to figure out the general, I want more data points and this is one of the few things that I don't have much on but think will be useful later.

The problem is that I have a different sort of empathy (in addition to that), I learned to act and word things in a way that keeps others calm so that I don't need to work as hard to remain calm myself. Best case scenario, I'd figure out a way to filter all that out and actually know what's internal and what's external but that's really unlikely.

As I said, I was barely awake and worded it poorly. Of course if I were asking about some trait about any other group I'd probably ask it the same way, I assume that people asking questions are simplifying their wording and I have a tendency to assume others do the same.

It should have been ""Why are women who tend to act catty that way the majority of the time?"" Now that I've given more thought to it I guess I'm really asking ""Why do conflict seeking women tend towards being overt in their desire to get into fights and why does nobody seem to respond to them the same way they would a man who does the same?""

That was in reference to things that could simply be worded poorly, I assume the best but prepare for the worst (basically I politely ask the person to expand on their statement or question). Keeps a lot of arguments from starting.

I know all I need to about the way a troll's mind works, if avoiding starting trouble when I can keeps trolls from interacting with me and makes troll bait stay away from places I frequent then all the better. Trolls want to piss others off, pissing them off keeps others calm, and troll bait is getting to get pissed off at something anyway so way bother caring. Keeping calm and trying to be kind has worked out pretty well for me, it's gotten me some renown in two subs (which lead to me becoming a mod in one) and infamy in another which is populated by trolls and people so insane that the trolls don't even need to do anything to watch people rage (you know that one kid in school who thought everybody loved them but was overtly detested, that's basically what the sub was).",0

I know how that goes. I went through that with one of my closest friends, he apparently has a habit of acting like a complete ass towards people after he's known them for awhile, I think there are some issues there but I really don't know. I was going through some shit so in a way I kind of rationalized his behavior, I thought I deserved it and in a way I think it helped me (kind of a detox of sorts from what had been going on before, it let me ease into things and get used to just dealing with the pain I had instead of always knowing that more was waiting). He wised up towards the end of the school year, things got better.

I also understand this sort of thing, thankfully not personally. I was actually looking the reasoning behind having these sorts of relationships when they aren't forced. Why people have frenemies (however you spell it, it's an idiotic concept).

I'm with you here as well, problem is there's never benefit for me. I'm always putting on an act, always. I just can't let it slip for a second, I have no idea why. Maybe I'm scared that if I do then I won't be able to get it back, maybe I won't want to, maybe there's nothing left behind it or at least not enough to really be a person, maybe I'm just scared to find out. I don't know. It wears me down, I pick my friends based partially on who's easiest to be around. Who projects the least so I can feel more without needing to worry that what I'm feeling is somebody else's emotions. Who lets me put on the simplest masks so I don't need to work quite as hard to stay in character. Who understands me best when I just can't seem to translate my thoughts. Who cares the least when I can't keep my thoughts to myself, when I can't sugarcoat every syllable. Who makes me feel the most human. It's funny, when I was young all I wanted was to seem like everybody else and be treated the same as them but now all I want is somebody who'll accept me for who I am, not who I pretend to be.

You can only be told that the person doing it is helping you so many times before you start to believe them on some level, it didn't matter that I knew it was abuse I thought I deserved it but I had no idea why. When it stopped I couldn't figure out why and I was starting to come to terms with the fact that I didn't deserve it and that hurt, when he started to try to bully me it gave me something else to attribute the pain to, something that was causing me more pain and giving me more time to come to terms with things because the same part of me that felt I deserved the earlier treatment clung to what he was doing. Honestly I think he may have saved my life by doing that, I was depressed and prior to what he was doing I was heading into suicidal territory but when he did I recovered a bit, I had more time to deal with the pain. I was still depressed, I had figured out how to act a long time before so nobody really knew, not even the people who saw me when I couldn't keep it going (it's funny because that was the same time that my brother became depressed due to an inhaler he had been put on and he seemed pretty damn happy compared to me, he bottomed out well above where my act topped out but he's the one that people went crazy over).

No, most of them won't. When I slip a little people think I'm putting on an act to push people away. I'm unreadable, seemingly insane (as anyone who can't be understood but appears to understand what they're saying does), unapproachable, unpredictable, and utterly alien. At least that's how I've been described. That's ignoring all of the pain and rage and sorrow that I'd have to deal with if I actually tried to be me again, it's not something I can deal with on my own and there's nobody that I can trust to help me through it, plenty of people I can trust to abandon me because they can't deal with somebody like that. It's not a matter of them not caring about me, it's a matter of people having been taught that they can't care. People rarely do the hard thing, especially when there are easier options with the same results. Have you ever felt as if you don't belong, that you were truly alien and simply weren't meant to be where you are, that you belong in some other place, some other time? That's my life, every waking second I feel as if I don't belong, that society itself rejects me (and in general society agrees on that point) and thus I wear a mask, I make nice, I play at being like everybody else yet still I feel truly alone. I found that I'm far from alone, that others like me feel the same, that when I've tried to explain myself to others around them it hasn't simply resonated but it was as if I was speaking from their heart instead of my own even there, even though I'm solidly a part of them I feel as if somehow I don't belong.

As for how it affected me. I know for a fact that my life would be much different if i had a male figure in the house. I'm 34 now but when i was a teenager (13-18) i started to rebel against my mother and it ended up with her kicking me out of the house at 18. The day i understood the difference between male and female and that physically she could no longer do anything to me that's the day i stopped taking her serious. I started arguing, stopped listening to her because there wasn't a male figure much stronger than me to put me back in line. Women nowadays like to say that they can do it without a man or that they don't need a man but as a product of a single mother home i can say that it's very important to have a male in the house to maintain order, specialty if you have boys.

I don't remember much more then him always having to work and be late for dinner, or not at all. Get recalled from holidays, those kinda things (he was mostly in managing position for bigger IT company's in my country back in the 80's). Other then this it are just memory's of never being good enough. Sure i dropped out of college but got a good job straight away and honestly right now its not really any detrimental for me. I got a solid job and have been for the last 8 years or so.

In the mid 90's he started his own small company which he always made us feel was doing pretty OK. I joined the company in '99 as purchaser and helped with building pc's. Even passed a job i got offered at that time where i would have made nearly double the money and would have gotten my MCSE.

13 dec 2000 he got a stroke and went into a coma till he passed away the 24th. Sure, Christmas basically sucks every year for me now but that's another story.

The company at that point had only my dad, me and the tech guy so it was rough for a bit. I tried my best to push the company forward and doing pretty decent with it being a 23 year old guy who just lost his father. Unfortunately it turned out that it didn't go that well with the company and even tho i managed to increase sales by a good 20% in the first quarter it was just not enough and we had to file for bankruptcy. 

In this time we found out that my father had both a drinking and gamble problem which he had been able to hide pretty good to us. Sure we knew about the drinking and tried to do something about it but that was a mission impossible it seemed. 

So all in all, i can honestly say i have no happy memory's of my father. However i feel like i forgave my dad. Around Christmas i will actually miss him and still shed a tear when i hear ""Father and son"" by Cat Stevens.

 I just remember that no matter how shitty he was to me as a father. He made me who i am as of today. And that is someone i am comfortable with and happy with. ",0

Anyways. One of my best friends is a guy. He's a fairly attractive guy, and I've been told I'm a rather attractive girl. He is also quite sexually frustrated; at almost-19, he's never gotten anything beyond a handjob, (and even that was a less-than-satisfactory experience for him). He hasn't had great luck with women, because of some personality issues that can cause him to be rather close-minded and make him not so great at relationships. So yeah, he's got some sexual tension going. 

But despite that, our friendship has been platonic since it started, and continues to remain that way. There is no sexual tension, and we are not attracted to one another at all; we've effectively friendzoned each other. We joke that it would be practically incest if we were to ever be sexual. We basically have a relationship similar to that of brother and sister. This is the nature of our friendship, and both of us have communicated that and are very happy with it. We advise each other; we're each others' wingmen; we support each other.

Again, this is, I think, fairly unique to us and our situation: we've known one another since the third grade, and such has been the way of our relationship since then. Knowing someone since childhood makes it much more difficult to view them sexually, which has probably helped our relationship stay so strongly platonic. So that's just some food for thought, but in my experience it is definitely possible.",1

Well, you know how seeing someone attractive and seeing them naked are two different states? Like in terms of how the latter is more closely tied to arousal?

For a person with a fetish concerning a bodytype, the feeling when you see someone that fits that is more sexual and intense, like the comparison above. A fetish feels a lot more like an obsession where there are very strong emotional connotations to the subject... Although it is very sexual to the person, it's not quite linked directly to sex itself. It's less that you see someone attractive and want to have intercourse, and more that you tunnel-vision onto the subject of the fetish. (Although there are plenty of fetishes that concern having sex in a specific *manner*- Sadomasochism for example- but that's where it gets messy.)


 Because of that, it's less ""I want him in me"" and more, ""I could probably orgasm just from running my hands along his bones."" (I'm using my own example as I can't really speak for people into fat. I'm into deathly thin guys :S Weird, I know.) Most people will want both, of course, and they build off of each other a lot, but you can tell if you have them that they're two separate impulses. But there are plenty of people that have a fetish by the traditional sense wherein they can't be aroused by anything else and won't be interested in intercourse.

So yeah, that's why it kinda kills me when people say they have a ""fetish"" for red heads, because every time I see it it's only expressed as 'I like when girls have red hair'. You're not obsessed with red hair itself, you just consider girls with red hair to be the most attractive. A lot of times people will say they have a fetish out of being insecure over having a preference/type that they perceive to be rare and shunned but that actually isn't. ",1

High school dating is pretty limited. You have a small body of girls to meet (unlikely that you'll date someone from another school), and you have to deal with your parents' influence on your decisions. Even if you don't care what they think of your date, even if you have your own car to go out, you know that your parents will know when you leave and when you get home. It's like fishing in a private pond: You can catch a winner, but you'll be looking over your shoulder in case you do something you aren't supposed to.

College is more free: you have your own living space, your own transportation, and you're older, which means more date options. However, the limited pool is still there: you're probably going to date students from your school, you still have to work around class, etc. It's like fishing in that small pond, but without all the restrictions.

Adult life is fishing in the ocean. You get all the freedom, you can do whatever with whoever. But it's a lot harder to meet people: that limited focus in school made it easier to approach people, and without it it's harder to find a common ground to break the ice on. You can certainly find women, but it might be in an unlikely place, and you'll have to manage it between work schedules and stuff.",0

I assume you're talking about the previously sexually uninhibited wife in which case it should be noted that according to the OP in that post the issue was that before meeting him she **did** like it.

55198,55198,Mr_Diggums,AskMen,1389042365.0,"First and foremost, no BS. There is nothing more annoying than dating or setting up a date with a girl, and things seem headed in the right direction, when all of a sudden she ends things with a lame excuse. I don't care if I ""seem really awesome"" or the ""sex was really good"" or ""it was really really nice meeting you"". Spare me. It's all for naught if I'm getting rejected. If you're not looking to date, and he asked you out, make it known RIGHT AWAY that you're not looking to date. I smack my head so hard when a girl agrees to a date, and seems quite excited, only to end things because they ""aren't looking to date""...why the FUCK did you agree to a date then? Having an active OKC profile only magnifies this frustration. Hell, it's happened to me before the very first date. If you go out on a date and you're just not feeling a connection, say so...our egos can handle it. It beats second guessing where WE went wrong.

Second, the whole friend thing is very difficult. If you knew them in advance, then it is possible, and you can remain friends. However, if you don't know this person, they ask you out, and you reject them, they aren't going to be friends with you. I'm sure there are many awesome girls out there I could be friends with, but if I muster up the effort/courage to approach you and ask you out, I'm interested in dating you, not finding a new friend. Why should I spend time and effort becoming your friend when I could focus on a girl who wants to date me?

Long story short, be honest. When I get rejected, I would much rather know why so I can improve myself. Did I try too hard or not enough? What were my mistakes? Hell, sometimes there just isn't a connection. If they get very defensive (irrationally so), then you probably dodged a bullet. Just be upfront and don't waste time...every day that passes is another day of guys thinking about you and building you up.

Additionally, if you are correct in your assertion that the only place to showcase that standard is via media then it should be even more obvious.                            

I can't say that its what *you* may prefer per individual subjectivity but what *people* prefer as a general trend is noticeable, tangible, and real.  The media isn't in the business of throwing out random hooks and hoping one sticks - they pander do the masses with the widest net possible.                        

I'd wager easily over half of the people considered ""beautiful"" and represented as such be it magazine, television, film, etc are white.  The rest who are not, a large percentage of them have features that stand out among the white group.  How many black women with their natural hair do you see represented?

Take some time to talk to her and explain that it's your body and masturbating does not affect your intimacy with her or your feelings for her. It's a sexual urge and she can't always be around to fulfill all your sexual needs. Be firm, be kind. If the conversation isn't headed in a healthy direction, then break up with her.

My dad was a gynecologist. He thought it was a needless operation done mostly to inflate fees with the excuse that it prevented some infections due to poor hygiene.

I find that my inner foreskin is much more sensitive than the penis head and can be the source of very intense orgasms without involving any other part of the penis. It seems to me that it resembles the clitoris in sensitivity and location.

Perhaps circumcision was invented by women so the men could last longer? 

Or was it that men sacrificed the seat of sexual pleasure to please God. 

What a horrible god that would be, to create something, then love those who rip it off and throw it away just to prove solidarity with the guys that collect money from them every week for telling them what to think about god.

Being really big and muscular helps deter fights. Otherwise, keep an eye out for people that look like they could be trouble. Being drunk is the number one indicator. If they look like they might be pissed off about something (that confrontational look you mentioned), they could be looking for an excuse to start something. Steer clear of them.

Why then do I watch this stuff?

I marvel at how men and women can do some of this stuff while a buncha others surround them with bright lights, still cameras clicking in the background and all that stuff.

I look at the absolutely terrible acting and worse screenplays if ya wanna even call them that and tell myself I could make far better stuff with the gear they have and some willing actors.

I wonder where they are now, when they find out that this stuff isnt gonna make them rich or famous, and may even kill them.

But for me to even have to explain the attraction of a given work on film to my SO would be a burden, and take maybe telepathy to explain.

One thing it definitely is not, is wishful thinking, or a desperate turning to something my SO lacks or is unable to do for me..

I don't wanna be a porn star, or be in the scene, or even do what is shown to be physically possible although absurd. 

American porn is the worst in terms of sensuality and often turns on pretty nasty attitudes about young supposedly naive women, plus nearly always these days ends up with some salami size something shoved up the anus.

Japanese porn is more quirky and interesting as a cultural window into their sense of moral boundaries.

Euro porn has more body hair and 'normal' looking people.

They've compared themselves against their peers, pop stars, and actresses, and they don't think they're as pretty. They're scared that the guy's going to realize they aren't as pretty, either. And they don't know what the guy could possibly like about him. For girls like that, knowing that he's masturbating (probably to other women) is intimidating, and seems like the first step in him leaving you.

No, it's not rational, but it could happen for a high school aged girl in her first relationship who doesn't have much self-confidence and little experience with boys. After a few relationships under her belt, hopefully she'd adopt a more reasonable stance. OP's girlfriend is apparently a senior in college.

Ever hear of Maslow's hierarchy of needs? It's a theory. Everyone has certain needs they need to satisfy to feel fulfilled. First and foremost are basic needs like food, shelter, sex, stuff like that, followed by financial security, physical comfort, etc. Then comes love and friendship. Next need is a sense of accomplishment and success. The final, ultimate need, Maslow calls self-actualization. This can be described in layman's terms as becoming the best you that you can be. Fully discovering amd expressing your self. Only when you take care all of these needs do you feel fulfilled as a person.

I don't get too weird but mostly go for anal porn, but not a fan of the gaping stuff. Sometimes I like to watch a cute girl masturbate with a dildo. Sometimes it's fun to watch a girl take on multiple guys, when they all take turns jizzing on her face I'll imagine I'm one of them. But I would never do that in real life. Also once in a while I like to watch some of that sensual shit where 2 or 3 girls are doing it real classy like. Just depends on the day.

I'm not really into anal sex myself anymore, it was a taboo back when I was married but I've gotten it out of my system since and I'm fine with regular sex. But watching it is really dirty and that's pretty specific to why I'm watching porn in the first place. Actual sex is a completely different dynamic, it's about two people pleasing each other. Porn has a single purpose, to unleash my sexual thoughts through physical expulsion, the dirtier the better sometimes. But when I'm actually with a girl I focus on our mutual pleasure, soft and slow, hard and fast, some light spanking, and some dirty talk to get in her head and bring her to climax. Porn and sex are two completely different things for me and my partner should understand that.",0

Under 22 or 23 and women (and men I think) are still figuring out who they are and how to be comfortable in their own selves and finding what they want in life.

By the mid 30's  though... the ones that want to be crazy have 10 years of experience at being really really crazy.  Really really really really really crazy.  

Everyones  life experience is different, and that shapes  who they are, young people are generally in better physical  shape and that has its advantages, but by their  30's they know what  they  do and  don't  like generally, and that helps a lot.  People in their 30's who got the wrong end of a relationship with  someone who discovered they wanted someone else can be really jaded or really awesome, there's no one rule of thumb.  

Much older than that and you're into women who are primarily worried about their kids and career and their needs and you either are  part of that or you aren't, and they don't have the time or inclination to put up with your bullshit, or to invest in you either.

When we were together we had made a list of restaurants that we wanted to try - so about every three months or so we'll get together and still try one out.

I'm not sure how my class went completely left from yours (it's wasn't psychology of sexuality so there's that). Honestly from a purely logical stand point your view makes complete sense. The points my classmates brought up are probably going to sound harsh. But it was something along the lines of ""maybe each person in the relationship has doubts that they're suppressing and cohabitating is an easy way to move forward without taking the plunge directly into marriage. In that instance they should listen to their gut and not get married."" Another point was that there were expectations that living together is a trial run and things will be different once vows are exchanged. When things didn't change after the wedding day, harsh realities set in and one or both spouses bailed. 
Either way, there are so many factors that go into why the data looks the way it does. But I will readily admit even though one side has less divorces, there is still a significant sample of people who live together first, get married, and are still together.

Promiscuous describes an action (or series of actions, I guess).  Someone could sleep with 400 people then meet someone they want to be monogamous with, right?

Again, you're assuming that having a partner means they only sleep with one person.  Open relationships are pretty common, you know.  There's more to partnership than sex.

When I was your age I had the pleasure of sleeping with a very sexy redhead who was 48 and she rocked my world. Definitely turned me on to older women. A couple years later I married a woman 12 years older than me. It didn't work out but it wasn't due to age so much as personality. I have a friend from high school who is still married and madly in love with a woman 15 years older than him. Since the divorce I've dated girls from 29 to 50. Older women tend to be much more laid back and open with their sexuality, although I hear the younger ones are more accustomed to the porn fantasies and more willing to do dirtier stuff but I can't speak for the early 20's crowd since I haven't been with one of those since the 90s.

But now I find myself attracted to and dating women about 10 years younger than me. 33 seems to be my ideal age. It changes as you get older. When you're younger, older is better but that only lasts so long. Girls my age are hit and miss - if you meet 40 something chicks in bars they can be pretty washed up and ragged but there are definitely some good ones, you just have to find them.

So I was dating this girl in high school. She wore hearing aids just like me.

Looks wise, I thought she was kind of hefty, and she didn't talk much. I kept thinking that our time together was really awkward because we didn't say much to each other. 

I got this feeling like ""what will people think if they see me with her?"" and started thinking I could do better than her. I rationalized it by reminding myself that she lived 45 minutes away. 

So I just started blowing her off, ignoring her texts and just hoping she would go away (she went to another HS). 

I *dumped* her because I was a shallow person, I was selfish and a coward. 

Of course, I did not realize this until much later, when I found out she had been really hurt by what happened. 

What I've realized since then:

* She was **not** fat. 

* A 45 minute drive to see her is not a big deal.

* She was just as nervous and awkward as I was. 

* She genuinely liked me. (And is the only person I know for a fact that ever has liked me). 

* I hurt her, a lot. 


I ran into her in college a few years ago, she did not seem to hate me, she met someone else after me and had a good relationship. She's moved on.

More than 7 years have passed since we dated, I have not been in a relationship since. I'm still a virgin.

I regret what happened very much, I hurt her and later realized I hurt myself as well. I would give almost anything to go back and undo it. 

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm over her. I have no illusions about getting back together and even so, she lives in a different state. I just regret that I destroyed what could have been a beautiful relationship. ",0

73157,73157,SentientBagOfWater,AskMen,1389198937.0,"The drink-buying think is a minefield.  I just steer clear of it, for basically the reasons described.  I will buy drinks for friends who I think are going to stand their turn for the next round - I don't care about the exact same dollar amount being spent, just that it's give and take.  It's possible that we'll be friends enough for that to happen on the night we meet in a bar, it's certainly happened before, but it's by no means guaranteed.

There have been plenty of occasions where women I've spoken with have basically closed the toll-gate when it's clear I'm not paying said toll in a beverage based currency, a step beyond what your friend describes.  It's honestly pretty funny to watch.  Only once have I had a lady give me a good dressing down for it, explaining that it was my *job* to buy her a drink if I wanted to talk to her.  That was fun too.

The point of that long-winded context is to justify what I think is the right approach to this type of situation, which is to politely decline the drink (""No, I'm fine for the moment thanks"").  If you're happy enough to talk to this person for a while then do so anyway.  You've not set up an expectation, and you're free to use your social graces at a more comfortable pace to indicate that you're not out looking to meet someone if he starts overtly hitting on you.  Even if he pulls the plug as soon as your boyfriend does come up you've still hopefully been able to have a nice interaction.

If you're not in the mood for talking to strangers, or he otherwise doesn't seem like someone you'd like to talk to, then thank him for the offer but tell him you're just talking to your friends at the moment.  Telling him all about your boyfriend is less important than just declining politely.  He may or may not be a jerk about it, but at least you've done your part by not jerking him around.

74565,74565,DreadfulRauw,AskMen,1389208327.0,"&gt;At bars without no activities - What do you do? Just sit around and make innane conversation?

Not inane, but yes.  This is the time for your sparkling wit.  Be funny and entertaining.

&gt;At bars with dancing? Is there another way to flirt/express interest? I'm always getting invitations to dance and I cannot dance.

If it's a dance club, that's gonna be the go to move.  Here's the secret.  Guys who can't dance still get more play than guys who won't dance.  she's not looking to see your moves.  She's looking to see if you'll risk looking silly for her.

&gt;On dancing. Is there ever a point where you're not deliberately thinking though every movement? If I stop deliberately trying to move body parts (copying other people), I just end up standing there. This makes it impossible to talk or flirt or do anything other than ""swing hip left/swing hip right"". I've played music my whole life, but the only dancing I have experience with is silly wildly swinging around (as a little kid) and mosh pits (and neither are appropriate for this scene).

Again, just fake it.  Better to be awkward on the dance floor than alone at the bar.

&gt;More dancing - How do I get over the worry that I'll slam into someone if I move to quickly/the wrong direction. I've also spent a lot of time in different types of fighting training, and I'm worried that if I actually manage to get ""lost in the music"" I might carelessly deck someone. Does this actually happen? Or am I worrying over nothing?

Just don't do full on punches or something and you're fine.  If it's informal, unstructured dancing, people bump into each other.  It happens.

&gt;Even more dancing - Do traditional ballroom, swing, mambo, etc classes help in social dancing situations? I'm really terrible at that type of dancing, too.

If you have no rhythm they help, but normally you'll only do those dances at clubs that focus on them.



&gt;Multiple women interested - If you're in a situation (group conversation) where you've developed a good amount of rapport with multiple women who seem interested and you find both interesting, how do you deal with this without making things awkward for everyone? (especially if they are friends)

Pick one.  Or, if you're ballsy, ask them both out.

&gt;After Strike one - If you're in a group situation where you've really hit it off with one of the people, to the point where other people present suggest you go out, but when you ask them out, they are in a relationship. Is it okay to still pursue anyone from the rest of the group? That seems kinda skeezy (working your way through the room) like, so I've always assumed it was bad form.

As long as you're respectful to the first one, and don't start ignoring her, you might be fine.  If she likes you, she might help you with one of her friends.

&gt;One and done? - I've always been of the mindset that you don't want to hit on multiple people in the same group. Is this just naive? If it's kosher, how do you go about it? Do you go ahead and ask in front of the crowd?

Depends on the group, but as long as you're being open and flirty, They'll know why you're there and act accordingly.

&gt;Expectations? - I just moved to a new area and don't have a lot of friends who toke. I invited my next door neighbor over to partake, and we seemed to have a decent friendship going for a while, smoking and BS'ing about our lives. A couple of months ago, she seemed pissed at me for not making a move on her (I'm sort of guessing but in retrospect she dropped a lot of hints) and cut off contact. Am I in the wrong for not making a move and/or not specifying that I was interested in her as a friend?

Not your fault.  she could have made a move too.

&gt;Coed sports - Is it ever acceptable to ask someone out on the field (those moves!)? Is it super tacky to do it in front of their team-mates?

That's the point of adult sport leagues.  you're in your 20's and playing kickball.  If you're not doing it to get laid, it's just a little sad.

&gt;Houdini - If a woman asks you out for drinks ""to celebrate"" after something positive happening, but disappears before you can go out/exchanging numbers/etc, is it better to ask about that thing or just ask her out again? Or give it up?

Just ask her out again.  Don't bring up old stuff.

&gt;Ditching the group - Is it okay to split from the group you are out with to pursue a lady who approaches your group to hit on you. Are there limitations on this? If it's really overtly sexual? If you're someone's ride home?

Depends on the transportation situation where you live.  Don't abandon someone with no way to get home, but it's cool to arrange something else for them if you're going to be hooking up.  This is easier in towns with good taxi systems.",0

&gt;Maybe in a bar or something, flirty is flirty (especially with people you didn't know before that night), but if it's with someone you know, sometimes people are just being themselves and nothing more. 

Ok, you raise a fair point there. People with whom you have a prior relationship -- that's trickier, you're right. Sometimes a person just has a bubbly/gregarious personality that comes out once she's more comfortable around you. That's one's just difficult all the way around, I give you. 

And the 'work flirt' definitely exists. But you aren't CRAZY to have asked her out! KUDOS to you. You were absolutely correct to act on those signals -- and that was massively unfair of her to give them so heavily if she wasn't all about you taking the hint.

It's part of the social agreement. We spend ridiculous loads of effort to look as close to an 8,9 or 10 as possible -- money on clothes, time on makeup, money on makeup, time at the gym, pastries not eaten, mental suffering when it's obvious our 7.5 high note is weak next to our friend's standard 9 -- and then we make it obvious we wouldn't reject you.

74740,74740,Mr_Diggums,AskMen,1389209401.0,"Dang dude...that's a lot of reflection you done there. My first impressions is that you're thinking about this WAY too much, which is holding you back and making you more self-conscious than need be. That said, here's my two cents.

Bars:
With ""no activities"" you meet strangers and talk. It doesn't have to be inane conversation...get to know people, joke around, flirt, etc. Trust me, it seems weird. I've gotten high and realized that a bar is just a bunch of impaired people yelling bullshit at each other, then proceeded to do just that the next night and have a blast. You'll get better with practice, but maintain the mentality that you're just out to have fun, and not just to meet/bang girls. 

Dancing:
Just HAVE FUN and BE CONFIDENT. If you're so god awful that you can't find and keep the beat, then you might want to pass here, but girls love a guy who is confident enough to dance and have fun, even if he's not amazing at it. Just don't be ""that guy"" who tries too hard. Follow a girls lead yo! If you're invited to dance, accept! Worst case scenario, tell the girl ""I'm not a great dancer, but I'd definitely like to learn"" or ""Practice makes perfect"" or some BS. Anything that shows her you're fun, interested, and not too self-conscious. Eventually, you don't think about the moves you're making, and you just let the music/girl guide you...dancing can be fucking beautifully organic like that.

Other Dancing:
Nothing wrong with taking lessons. Will definitely make you better and is an avenue to meet more girls, but knowing swing/ballroom/salsa doesn't have that much ""run-of-the-mill"" application at your usual bump 'n grind establishment. 

Commuters:
Frankly, I've never tried here, and I just kind of take the same approach as one would at the gym, which is to check-out and not approach. If there are two situations where (I assume) women hate to be bothered, it's at the gym and when they're on their commute (likely reading or listening to music). Plus, it makes for an awkward rejection as there's no where to go. If you're REALLY feeling something, maybe make a comment about something they're doing or wearing or whatever, but I usually just stay clear. Hell, maybe you'll see them at a bar or something and you can mention your commute as an ice-breaker (Hey, do you happen to take X bus to Y in the morning? Me too! *cue insta-sex*)

Multiple Women:
Easy there Casanova. Unless you're dropping $$$ in bottle service, none of these girls are likely looking to sleep with you right away, but are just enjoying yours and the group's company. If you really do think multiple girls at the same table are interested, welp, you'll just have to pick 'n choose or do some recon via mutual friends. If you're looking to date, you don't exactly have the easy option of trying out all of them in a short period of time. Regarding ""strike one"", asking someone out who is unavailable does not exclude you from asking out their friends. A first date is based upon mutual attraction and interest, and you are allowed to be attracted/interested to/in multiple people at once. Just don't make it evident that you're ""running through the numbers"" and you should be fine. It's ok to hit on multiple people in the same group, but only if it's innocent flirtation and not creepy. Otherwise, all of the girls (and their collective opinion) will quickly brand you as the weird creepy do. Be playful, not rapeful. 

Expectations:
If this 420 girl was cool and attractive, then you're an idiot for missing her hints. Cutting off contact seems weird to me (you were just being a nice neighbor), but you really only need to specify you're a friend if you're picking up on the signals. Really shouldn't be that hard to pick up on though after a lot of one-on-one time/toking.

Coed Sports:
You can ask out on the field, but it'd be much easier to let a lil' friendship develop over time and then see if they want to grab a beer or something after the game. That's not a date, it's just a post-game, and if that goes well, you can ask her out properly for a date where y'all ain't sweaty from the field. Save this for later in the season...don't want to get rejected after game 1.

Houdini:
She may just be nice and extended the invitation to everyone. Nothing wrong with following up in some manner. If you don't really know her and don't have her number, might as well let it go. If you're friends or in the same group, doesn't hurt to ask. Everyone likes a fun time.

Ditching the Group:
Are you kidding me? Why in the hell wouldn't it be ok? You know better than this.
In regard to limitations: If you're someone's ride home, if you have a girlfriend, or if you're a rapist/murderer, then it is not OK to split from your group to pursue sexy times with a stranger. Don't cockblock yourself and then insist that it's because you didn't want to split from the group.

I would never advise a guy to go up to a chick who's paying him no attention, flirting with other guys, looks at him once and her gaze never returns to him, who is utterly uninterested in him, to go cold ask for her number. That's stupid. 

When a girl is flirty with a guy, despite the stories we all have where the flirtation was mishandled on her part, it's still not crazy to assume she's into you and wouldn't turn down a number ask. It's our OBLIGATION to ACT like we're interested in you if we are. 

But despite guys calling for girls to ask THEM out more, how are girls supposed to know that you'd be flattered and glad -- and not revulsed that some homely chick actually thinks you'd be into her (as this thread makes clear is the mindset of far too many men.)

Yup. Also, girls get rejected ALL the time when they flirt with dudes. It's not like we're avoiding rejection by not asking ""want to go out?"" There's plenty of rejection in batting your eyelashes and making longtime conversation with a dude, then watching him ask some other chick for her number.

&gt;But usually things that say that I'm interested are if I flirt (obviously), if I talk about getting together outside of work, if I joke around more with you, stuff like that, the usual.

Exactly! I mean, if guy talks about getting together after work, she could totally be like 'oh yes lets! hmm... so there's this new place that opened, did you hear about it?' or whatever. 

&gt;I guess my whole point for being hesitant at first is just that when it's light flirting or even sometimes a little more than that, we may not react because we aren't sure what signals we're getting.

That's not insane. But I will say, when guys want to go out with a girl bad enough, they do ask her. They make a move. (And we've SEEN this, so of course that's what we're waiting for.) But ONLY when the opportunity cost of not doing so is high enough. I think I would rather wait to run across a guy who finds the opportunity cost of letting me get away too high to walk off :) (And why shouldn't I take the risk? Because every girl knows guys only want 8+s to make these moves. If you aren't an 8+ there is seldom an opportunity cost high enough to employ cognitive dissonance and ask him in the face of his disinclination to ask you.)",1

I'm sure I could be wrong, but I would say there isn't. I've been rejected, and it's really not bad at all. Some people might say it's different due to the actual confrontation, but to me at least, it didn't add anything.

Yeah, I agree for sure. Whether I've made an idiot of myself around a guy for days or whether I just go up and ask -- one isn't EASIER rejection than the other. Honestly, I feel like chicks already have SO MUCH that they're responsible for to make sure they get asked out in this society (be a size 2! wear makeup! don't wear makeup! be confident! don't be homely! be nerdy! don't be too nerdy! be attractive! but don't wear the accessories guys don't like! KNOW what accessories guys don't like! don't be fat! but be confident! no really confidence! but don't be fat! be hot! be forward! don't be too forward! don't be a bitch! but if you are make sure you're hot!) that guys honestly don't have to deal with, that when all y'all have to do is pick the chick you like best, read her signals and ask her out, but now WE'RE supposed to do that TOO.. it's aggravating.

&gt;May not be the case, but if I were in your shoes and the person wasn't flirting back, I don't think I'd pursue either. I might try being a bit more forward, but if that does nothing, I'd give up.

Shows that white people (and most else) consider white people the most beautiful?  I also don't provide sources because I am coming from the angle that this is like having to pop a paper to show rocks are hard.                                                 

&gt;I'd also like to clarify that I'm not trying to say that Asian women are actually the standard of beauty but simply pointing out that saying white women are is somewhat inaccurate.              

Ahh so that is why they don't support that.  It did seem as if you were asserting that with the way you replied initially, thanks for the clarification.  I don't think its inaccurate at all btw, still haven't seen anything that says otherwise.  There is clearly more nuance to apply to it but boiled down, I think it stands pretty firm.                                                        

&gt;White women are the default setting for beauty and white people control what the beauty standard is are two separate statements.                 

Perhaps, but certainly not contradicting ones?  They are related and feed into each other.                                  

&gt;I'm not sure your Lucy Liu example is entirely accurate or at all applicable. I realize that beauty standards differ between western and Asian countries but the difference is more like women going from a 9 to an 8 than a 9 to a 4.              

I have no idea what this means, can you clear the number thing up?             

&gt;(side note: I'm not actually sure one way or another but I'd be curious to see if there was a difference between what Asians and what Asian Americans find attractive in women). Are you making the argument that Lucy Lui is considered attractive in America because she looks more white than Asian, because again that would suggest white women would always be at the top of attraction poles followed closely by other races in descending order of similarity... 

Yes, as I did so with the black women example (lighter skinned, straighter haired, mixed black women are more prevalent and considered more).                 

&gt;which would in my opinion at least put Latina's above Asians which isn't the case.                         

We aren't discussing a hierarchy below white people however, and we never were so I won't go further into that.                          
            
As far as the two separate points, if you read the previous discussion where this comes from I am just responding to assertions from the other poster (media and such) and I wasn't the one to originate the media point.

I like a girl to be fashionable, and not afraid to try experimental styles. She wants to rock blue hair? Awesome. Piercings? Tattoos? Noice. Stylish peacoat? Awwww yeeeaaah.

I pair best with introverted types, so snuggling and Netflix please. But we gotta get out of the house and really party it up every now and then, but even as a guy in my 20's trying to party every night just socially drains me. 

Also, she's gotta love coffee. And the internet.

&gt;being overweight is unhealthy and if people don't care about their own body, I wonder what else they don't care about, hygiene, punctuality , and generally trying to constantly grow as a person, how can I be with someone who will drag me down, how can I trust them to raise any children we have?

The first part is exactly the mentality that I have. But I also know that just because they are overweight, it doesn't immediately mean that they also have poor hygiene, growing problems, etc. You obviously can't know until you try. 

It's not your fault you feel this way, you were raised believing a certain thing, and it's very hard to completely erase the idea that you were raised on. Even if you did try to date a bigger lady, you might notice her slugging along (as overweight people tend to), and you may find yourself disgusted. It wouldn't be a good relationship if you're battling with their lifestyle. You would really have to come to terms with their obesity and either help them grow healthier, or ignore it (although I wouldn't be able to ignore it, I can hardly ignore my extra 30 lbs).

In the former, it is very difficult to see how a relationship could form without there being some abuse of power - if he is in a position of authority over her, then naturally she will look up to him, but to take advantage of this is an abuse of power. 

In the latter, the girl is not emotionally mature enough to realise she is projecting other problems onto him, but he is, and if he doesn't prevent it happening, then this is also abusive, as he is taking advantage of her vulnerability.

Both these forms of abuse aren't limited to younger-older relationships, and can happen at all ages. It's just that in this situation it is very unlikely that a relationship will have formed free of anything like this. The fact that people know this will make it doubly difficult, as this kind of relationship will constantly need to be justified and legitimized to family and friends of those involved, which must be a huge strain.",0

I was pretty buzzed but not out of control.  I had to have security come and the cops to open the room which happened to be in my name. The cops asked her 2 questions and made her let me in. Is this your husband? Does he pose any danger to you or your children?

These issues always happened in front of my small children and family.

To put it bluntly, they don't really care, although that sounds a lot more callous than it is. Really, it just means that if their buddy is happy, then they recognize that that's really all that's important.

In my experience, pretty much the only way that a guy will speak out against a buddy's girlfriend is if he gets the sense that she's taking advantage of him, cheating on him, or manipulating him (trying to isolate him from friends and family, lying, persistently undermining his confidence, etc.). And when that happens, most guys will assign a lot of weight to their friends speaking out, precisely because they almost never do speak out. It's also probably worth noting that how good of friends they are matters a lot. I have lots of guys that I would consider friends, but only 5-6 that I'm close enough to that relationship warnings/advice could conceivably be 'in-bounds'.

In my dating life, I've only had one girlfriend that any of my friends expressed reservations about (and they were right to; we weren't good for each other). Conversely, I've only spoken negatively about a couple of my friends' girlfriends, out of dozens. 

That's why the brief description that you gave seems unusual, when stacked up against my own experience. In my experience, none of the guys that I know would seriously try to convince a buddy to dial back his relationship, presumably so that he'll be more available for hanging out. They'll tease him for spending all of his time with you, but no more than that.

Just based on my own experience, I'd say that either the friends have more serious reservations with you that your BF isn't letting on (less likely) or your BF wanted to back off and it was easier to scapegoat his friends than be honest (more likely).

Or, alternately, his friends just aren't very much like the guys that I've been friends with.

Right on, and if he's so easily influenced that he'll break up with you because his friends wanted to spend more time with him, then that's pretty crazy. Either: 

A) he agreed on some level, and wanted to spend more time with them instead of with you. Attributing it to his friends just made it easier to explain, or
B) He has crappy friends and is too spineless to make his own choices

My guess would be that it's A, but in either case, life's too short to spend it with people who fall into either category. And FWIW, I wouldn't worry about this kind of stuff moving forward. Most guys understand that their friends are entitled to relationships and deserve to be happy.  

I'd definitely recommend that, going forward, you try to think of it as just a case where your priorities didn't happen to align at this specific time in your lives. For whatever reason, he wants to spend most of his time with his friends, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. There's no shortage of guys out there who are looking to get more involved in a relationship, and I'm sure you'll find one if that's what you're after. ",0

Even if it isn't an affair, that probably just means that she figured she could ditch you and go find some hot guy to have a good time with. She probably ignored the simple reality that men tend to do better in the dating world after age 40, but as the expiration date got closer she finally had to take an honest look at the situation.

I hate the idea of giving any kind of advice here, since I'm a 20-something guy who's never been married. I just haven't lived enough to put myself in your shoes, and I have no idea what my opinion on this would be if I had another 20+ years and a marriage under my belt.

We got in some sort of argument over it but they did it anyway, then she called up her weed guy and had him bring some pot over for her and her friend and told me to go away or he wouldn't give it to them.

I am 70 years old (OK 70 years on Feb 1) and had a marriage that lasted 24 years from 30 to 54.  Then another relationship took me from age 58 to 63. Now I am in my third and it will prolly last til one or the other of us falls off the perch.

X1 cheated on me and was difficult to live with for ten years before I finally pulled the pin and checked out. The separation was more fair to her than me, but hey at least there were no kids to support and a low legal bill. A bigger fight would net the same from the smoking ruin with more to the lawyers.

I was practical more than retributive then and am still.

Shopping for a new relationship after my marriage was in separation hell, was an eyeopener to the various shorthand words women use online to hide discouraging features.

Also starting around 45 it is a 'buyers market' for men and a increasingly difficult one for women over 45.

By 70 there are ten women for every guy with a pulse.

Lotsa women would love some hunk ten years under their age, but what they get offered are portly bald dudes up to 20 years older than them looking for a nurse with a purse.

Guys with decent income and looking pretty good are the wet dream of a much bigger pool of experienced divorced women with or without jobs, careers, kids.

x2 basically recruited me (she was 6 yrs younger than me.) and used me to set up a better retirement scheme for her. She failed, and I am outta that nonsense.

My current squeeze is as well off as I am and looks great, we are planning a fine time economically spending time in the country, Europe or Asia from time to time.

Quite possibly your current wife has had a chat with a few realistic people and knows this news too.

Instead of letting people simply live their lives a lot of people will simply try to pull others down because they get higher up relative to the others. The easiest explanation to swallow is that these are just bad people and they're rare but that's not the case, they're everywhere and common and the explanation is simple, empathy (though if psychology advances things then it won't be a single word but still two concepts). There is affective empathy, the ability to respond to the emotions of others (this is theorized to be a result of emotional contagion but outside of certain groups there is more evidence that emotional contagion doesn't exist). This would be expected to be common but in practice seems to be rare, people are often selfish and provably will often act in ways that detriment others with no direct gain for themselves. There is also cognitive empathy which is the ability to understand another's emotional state. People readily show this even when they are simply taking pleasure in another's pain. People confuse the ideas, they recognize that they understand another person and believe they feel for them in fact many would go so far as to thinking they feel because of them. By confusing these ideas they hurt one another but still feel as if they're good people, they write off the pain they cause others as being random chance or even deserved for some reason. Most think they're doing good and see nothing else, cognitive dissonance is a powerful influence.

The human body is exceedingly fragile and our sense of direction isn't all that great (at least in the grand scheme of things) even with points of reference. You'd be almost guaranteed to get lost, and most of the world isn't all that habitable. You wouldn't be able to go all that fast without risking bodily harm due to the speed itself add to that issues of breathable atmosphere (limiting height) and collisions (at high enough speeds a water droplet can do as much damage as a bullet). Even if you found ways around all that you'd still need to worry about storms as they are far more common at higher altitudes, you can have random lightning strikes within a cloud. You'd also have to consider all of the social and governmental issues. Imagine that some government found out that somebody had superpowers of some sort, how long until they're made to vanish or simply coerced into doing that parties bidding. The only way I can really see to circumvent that is to publicize the abilities or totally ignore them, the former would have all sorts of consequences from worship (there would be cults, there are always cult-like followers of people of any level of fame) to corporate coercion to get endorsements and the latter would probably feel like a waste. Superpowers suck even if you can mitigate the negatives inherent of any given power since they are so unusual and in most cases useful that there is no way they wouldn't change things radically, you don't want to be at the heart of radicle change. If that weren't the case then superpowers wouldn't be some great thing because they would be common, then you'd be dealing with issues of class based on one's power and how capable they were with it. That being said would I be willing to risk it for the right power set (with the proper immunities), yeah but I wouldn't settle for something so simple as flight since having the power itself would put me in danger and there would be all sorts of caveats to keep certain things under conscious control. Keep in mind that there are people with what could best be considered super powers, the problem is that since our world is full of disappointments with really cool things they're always inherently shitty ones (empathy and super senses are a good example, they're a matched set most of the time even if the intensity varies) due to a number of factors. It's not the sort of stuff people advertise because it simply isn't that interesting some people are insanely flexible, some can identify and match any note, some can reproduce works of art perfectly from a single exposure, some people never forget.

Manhood is something earned and taken away, and having it taken away can put you at risk: physically, emotionally, etc. Trans people don't like being misgendered, and it's similarly uncomfortable for men to take their ""manhood"" away.

Male animals are expendable, because they do not have the reproductive investment that females do (There are situations where this is reversed: Seahorses and Jacanas spring to mind, where males are primarily responsible for parental care), and generally reproductive capabilities are limited by the number of females, not the number of males. Males are thus used as ""defenders"" in many species - the stallion of a herd of horses protects the mares and foals at significant risk to himself because he is less valuable, in an EVOLUTIONARY sense.

It's not about being ""lesser"", it's about being expendable and that putting your life at risk is better than putting a woman's or child's life at risk. In species where we see males with more reproductive investment and are the limiting factor for reproduction, females tend to be the 'defenders' and put themselves at more risk. 

And while all this is biologically constructed, we as humans can look past that and treat each other as equally valuable. Or we should. Especially given we're not going to near extinction any time soon.

Maybe your changing back to the good guy you were when you first started dating has her changing her tune.

It's a question you are going to have to ask her yourself or get it out of her through counseling. I went to a variety of counselors, psychologist and even a psychiatrist with my Ex. I was married 16 years and have 3 beautiful children. I stayed in the marriage because of the kids at the later half of the 16 years and tried to stick it out but couldn't take it (Her and the IPV) anymore. I needed my sanity and life back again. 

The hurtful comments like your SO spouted were weekly occurrences with my Ex. They built up over time and just hurt more and more. I could go days with everything normal and then boom! She would throw a dagger at me out of left field. My Ex was a very jealous women. Many things that I did good like excelling at work, coaching my kids, having many friends both guys and gals, travelling for work to beautiful places, going above and beyond to see my mother and father and do nice things for them because they lived far away. I could go on and on and on. She also used sex as a weapon the latter half of the marriage as well. So yours is all over your like a female dog in heat is very interesting. 

You need to find out what's going on in her head, seriously and revisit your thoughts about the big D as well. I have never felt depression so bad until I had to move out of my house when my divorce was final. I had to be medicated, I couldn't sleep, I could barely go to work at times and get out of bed.

It took 2 years for me to eventually get back to some type of normal feeling and no depression. I am remarried to a wonderful woman now for more than 5 years. She has 3 older boys and is almost 10 years older than I am. A hell of a lot more mature than my Ex. who was a little younger than I am.

We have had our issues but we work on them together. Whether it be just plain and simple communication or even going to counseling.

Like /u/LaTuFu said ""Otherwise, if she divorces a perfectly good husband for no reason--she must be a bitch.

So, her not feeling attracted to you turned into her not ever being attracted to you, and her feeling the marriage is not good any more turns into wanting to divorce when the time comes. She was probably projecting your current situation into the future, and seeing the same person and the same lack of attraction, and decided she doesn't want that marriage.

What you've done is show her that things don't need to be how she thought they would be.

When you say you agreed that you would divorce when the kids left, was that arrived at after discussing other options - discussing how you could work on things to repair the marriage? Maybe you skipped that out of shock, or out of a desire to compromise or appease. Maybe she wanted you to put up a fight, and win her over again. Perhaps by agreeing with her rather than fighting, and then making these changes to prepare for life without, you've shown her that she needs to fight as well.

You two need to get onside with each other and start fighting for your marriage together.

As for the disappointment that you're not going to get to sow some wild oats, do you think negotiated non-monogamy would be a possibility some time in the future?

No, you don't *have* to. But if you have the opportunity to go somewhere and try something new and learn something, why wouldn't you? You will certainly have a lot of different experiences within your own country, or state, or even city. As long as you're open to them. And if you're open to them, why not to new experiences in other places too?

Lots of people who have travelled are pretentious about it. ""We did a cruise around the Pacific Islands and there was a pool and a disco on board and we had our own butler and we saw the natives of New Caledonia do a dance! Oh I love travelling!"" And if you asked them what they learned, ""I bought the cruise cookbook!"" These people travel because they are told they should, but they never step away from their comfort zone. Sounds like they are the people you've had most contact with. That sucks for you, those people are annoying as hell.

But you don't have to be pretentious to travel. You just have to be open-minded. From your second paragraph, it sounds like you are. If you do get a desire to go somewhere, take the chance. You might love it. But if you don't want to go outside the US, that's fine too. Just don't dismiss travel as pointless for everyone, like the OP of this thread did, I guess.",1

Telepathy is mind reading and that is a bit more problematic because its downsides wouldn't kill you but would instead just drive you mad. Take for example the way it was dealt with in Heroes, telepathy gets you the surface thoughts (assuming that one can do any more creates all sorts of issues and would likely add in a bunch of potential health issues) and those aren't usually structured or even controlled. You'd be getting the brain's equivalent of static, that just so happens to be random bits of songs, clips of shows, impulses, fractured thoughts, and memories. If you've ever heard of intrusive thoughts then imagine that to the nth power, you would risk psychosis by simply using the ability because you cannot control other people's thoughts. To make matters worse there is a similar ability (referred to in fiction as empathy but in real life as emotional contagion, literally feeling other people's emotions) which seems to exist in real life and excluding the small portion of the population who seem to have it the emotional output cannot be kept separate from one's own emotions, that means either attempting to control it and not allow it to function (imagine trying to control and shut down your hearing) or carefully control their own emotions so that they can shut them down and begin faking everything at a moments notice (upside is that they already need to learn to fake displaying emotions like the rest of the population). I wouldn't be too surprised to find out that telepathy actually exists to some degree but the ability is simply part of a known psychosis just as empathy is part of a known disorder (which thankfully does not directly affect sanity or intelligence).",0

I think feminism too often contributes to the erasure of male victims of rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence. It looks only at the most successful, most powerful males in western society while ignoring the vast vast numbers of males at the bottom to justify a BS theory of ""patriarchy"". It encourages the demonization of men. It views all areas of male suffering (high number of suicides, homelessness, workplace deaths, child support and family court, violent crime victim rate, circumcision, etc.) as ""patriarchy backfiring"" or re-frames those issues as ""benevolent sexism"" (so this bad thing happening to men that doesn't happen to women? Yeah, it's ACTUALLY worse for women because patriarchy.)

I happened to meet her the night she found out and we ended up talking for about seven or eight hours just the two of us. 

At one point in the conversation we got onto the topic of taking off bras at which point I said something about how easy it was etc. (little did she know I had never seen a girl's bra IRL, let alone taken one off myself). After some banter back and forth where I continued saying how easy it was she moved across her bed (we were sitting on it because she lived in a single room and only had one chair) and sat on my lap telling me to take off her bra. Thanks to the adrenaline and the lack of reactions in my face I managed to keep my cool and reached around and undid her bra with one hand my first try - I've never been more proud of myself than that night (I constantly hear about guys not being able to do it after years of sleeping with women and I did it my first try ever, feels good man).  I then joked about taking off her shirt which she responded to with, ""go ahead."" I assumed she was just joking around so I didn't go for it and conversation settle down. I slept over in her bed that night and a while later found out that she was coming on to me and cried herself to sleep that night because she thought I had turned her down, further hurting her self-esteem after the events of the day.

We ended up being together for four and a half years after that and she never let me live down missing that opportunity to sleep with her. Fair enough I reckon, looking back it was pretty obvious that I could have slept with her that night.",0
97982,97982,JAWJAWBINX,AskMen,1389405323.0,"Even controlled and focusable you have the issue of not being able to control other people's thoughts. If you want a single bit of information from somebody you won't really be able get that from them, you may get bits but you can't be sure you'll even get close to what you want. Then you need to consider how you'd get the thoughts, I think it's safe to assume that telepathy would function similarly to empathy in how the information is processed. That means that you wouldn't be able to easily find the gap between your own thoughts and those of the people you're reading for the vast majority of the population (the rest have brains that function differently enough that the nature of the thoughts, the way they're structured and presented, would likely be alien enough to tell they aren't your own if they didn't appear to your mind as from somebody else), they would appear to be your own unless you were able to determine the nebulous difference between your own thoughts and those of others. Even attempting to use it to simply ease interactions with others would be almost guaranteed to fail, people rarely think in social situations and when they do it's often unconnected or loosely connected. Interaction in humans is largely reactive, you have some responses that you were born with and others that you have learned and used to the point that they're rote. The only way I can see telepathy as being useful is if it only functioned to communicate on command, basically a mental instant messaging where you think something at somebody you've connected to or somebody you've connected to thinks something at you and the message is sent. It would be limited and useless in most situations but there wouldn't really be all that many drawbacks, assuming of course that one was limited in what could be sent.",0

There are a few important things though here that are relevant to your perspective.

First, the economy shit the bed HARD in like 2007/2008.  At 31, you got your foot in the door right before that.  If you started working without university you got in well before that.  Mid 20s means they graduated right as the economy was falling apart.  There will of course be fewer people seeing the same economic success as you and your friend.

Next, based on your post and answers, you are looking for a very specific kind of man and don't seem to be admitting it to yourself.  I believe you that it's not exactly about money, but it's about drive in a way that matches specifically with your values.  Ask yourself if you'd be satisfied with a musician who was mastering their craft while working at a supermarket.  Maybe they'll make it big, but the odds are against them, no matter how good or driven they are.  What about someone driven to succeed at a sport that doesn't bring in a lot of money.  Skateboarding, or lacrosse, or weightlifting, or whatever.  I'd wager these don't meet your expectations.  You're not after money specifically, sure, but what you're after pretty much leads to money, so you're going to have to accept that and look at the right place.

102065,102065,theCaitiff,AskMen,1389456859.0,"For most men, sex is a big thing and relationships need it to survive. For most men, sex is the conduit they use to achieve intimacy. The false culture of ""Real Men"" has twisted us not to show or experience emotions, so only in the throws of passion can they experience love or other ""weak"" emotions. It really all comes down to fear.

Intimacy scares them so sex is just a substitute. They've learned, like everyone else, that the people who can hurt you the most are the ones you let inside, so they stop letting people in. They only lower their emotional shields for a few moments in the height of passion, then slam them right back up as soon as the afterglow fades a bit.

I'm polyamorous and live some amazing people. As a tribe, we have rejected this false culture of fear. We are trying to get beyond it, but it isn't easy. Loving someone and letting them know it does allow them some power over you, this is true, but if they are good people your love gives you a bit of power over them too. It's a very strange two way street that until you get over the fear that they'll hurt you, you can't really see.

I'm a bit different personally. I need intimacy in my relationships. I want to have my soul utterly bare and naked before my partners, have them see me for all of my strengths and weaknesses, judge me, and accept me. I want to do the same for them. I want to mix our souls together until it is hard to see where I end and she begins. Ironically, if you've got a partner on the same page, it's easier to do that without sex. 

One of my two wives is damn near asexual. We only have sex once or twice a year at most, but we have regular date nights for quiet talking, holding, cuddling and the like. Another of my girlfriends is a victim of some really fucked up sexual violence, we've never had sex and might never, but again we find ways to be intimate and share each other without the need for sex. 

Sex is wonderful, and I enjoy the hell out of it, but many people use it as a crutch.",0

Of course, I say that as a white woman, so I could be totally wrong. But I do know that there's pressure on us, too, to look a certain way, and if you don't measure up it's easy to wind up feeling frustrated and inadequate and, eventually, to just stop trying.",1

Hollywood unknowingly promotes and maintains these stereotypes.  Some may acknowledge it, but they aren't going to stop either.  Look at the middle class white father -- he's usually a giant idiot.  Weak, clueless, and child-like.  He's too busy trying to be his kids' buddy.  The poor, exhausted white mother is the hero.  She has to be everyone's mother.  Make all important decisions.  Keep everyone in line -including her husband.  Look at Phil Dunphy character on Modern Family.  Dumb as dirt.  The date that didn't end.  I wouldn't trust him with matches, much less children.  
Are all white fathers like that?  Of course not.  However the ""all men are boys"" mantra is incredibly popular in American culture and lots of women marry over aged teenagers.  Lots of American men marry women who also perpetuate negative female stereotypes.
So the question for you shouldn't be ""are black girls less desirable?""  It should be: ""do I portray myself as the kind of woman that is attracts good, manly, men?""

To be completely honest with you, yes. I find girls who are 100% black to be less attractive. There's a few exceptions, but in general, I just don't see any appeal. Most black girls I've met have been extremely rude, and lacked many social graces that I take for granted not just from women, but from people in general.

On top of the rudeness, I've experienced most black girls simply CANNOT speak english whatsoever. I'm completely okay with other people who make grammar mistakes, spelling mistakes, etc. But if I can't understand what the fuck you're saying, it becomes a huge issue for me.

However, there's a half black and half white girl who I know pretty well, and she's incredibly attractive and not ghetto at all. So, I suppose for me, it's been mostly bad experiences with only the women who are 100% black.

For years, when my hair would be having what I call an ""80's day"" - huge and frizzy - I would complain and be annoyed by it, but he'd think it looked great. I've learned how to care for my hair in such a way that instead of just being frizz, I now have some waves and even a few loose curls...but even at that, I still have days of epic volume. I've learned to embrace it instead of being annoyed. 

It seems really common for women to be discontent with their hair though. I remember being in the dorms at summer camp and seeing all the work the other girls went through to make their hair ""presentable"" - all the blow drying and straightening and curling irons. Crazy. I get that we all have the message that sleek, smooth hair is the most desirable, even for us white girls, but seriously, why do we believe it? Why do we listen to that and learn to hate our hair for failing to live up to a standard that, for an awful large portion of the human race, is unrealistic? Most of us don't naturally have pin-straight hair, regardless of our ethnicity. And for those of us with curls or waves, our hair is not naturally perfectly sleek and polished. It's a ridiculous standard that is unattainable unless you're willing to spend a lot of time every day on your hair. And for me, one of the most frustrating things is that these standards which are put forth in the media are mostly held up and perpetuated by women and not men...it sometimes feels like we're playing into it and doing this to ourselves, and we don't have to.

My dating life has encompassed a broad spectrum of different races, classes, and backgrounds.

My SO is white, but I would not say that there is anything inherent about her, or Hispanic females that I have dated which make them inherently more desirable. 

You should remember, that you are only 18 and I am assuming that you are still in high school. The majority of people in high school are figuring themselves out as individuals and many cling to the pre-conceived racial stereotypes that are reinforced by their parents and social groups.

112784,112784,gazork_chumble_spuzz,AskMen,1389551809.0,"&gt;I am still surprised that this straight, sleek hair is constantly being talked about and spread about by media and people. To me, it is unoriginal, boring, and overplayed.

For years I wished for hair like that, because then I could get one of those choppy layered edgy haircuts that seem to work best with straight hair. Isn't it funny that we always wish for what we don't have?

&gt;The worst is that there are some people who straighten their hair and it really doesn't look good on them because of the type of hair they have and their overall look, but they still spend the time to straighten and whatever else it is they do.

Yep! I've found that my hair will look great straight with one haircut, and ridiculously bad with another.

&gt;I also think that meme that says something about how when a guy tells you he wishes you didn't put on makeup that he really means you wish you could hide your makeup tendencies more than you actually do hurts all of this. Because it helps to keep women doing what they are doing to make themselves ""attractive"". I get that often times there is a lot more going on than we guys realize, but the few times I have said something about wishing she wouldn't wear as much makeup, I wasn't lying. The guys that say this tend to really mean it, and maybe you are wearing makeup when he thinks you aren't so maybe educated him on it. 

Ha ha, well, like you said, I think this usually stems from guys not having a clue about makeup. So many guys go on and on about the ""natural"" look, and how women look better without makeup. What they don't realize is that what they *think* is a ""natural"" or bare face is often loaded with makeup. You would be amazed at the amount of effort that a lot of ladies put into looking like they aren't wearing makeup at all. 

The thing is, though, a lot of woman who wear makeup aren't doing it to make themselves attractive to men. Sure, some do. Some wear it because they feel ugly if they don't. But for many of us, we wear it because we love it. It's fun. We love playing with colours, playing up our eyes or our lips, painting it on. It's fun! A lot of people have a hard time believing that a woman could wear makeup for herself and not for men, but honestly that's a huge motivator for many of us.

&gt;But when he says something about wishing you wouldn't wear makeup or that you would wear less, then he is noticing that there is more than there usually is. Maybe listen.

I think it's nice to take your partner's tastes into consideration, but at the same time I'm not totally down with the idea that it's a woman's job to look the way guys, or her partner, want her to look. Ultimately, her face and the makeup she uses on it is up to her.",1

No, because there are a lot of people who are average, plain, or even ugly who still manage to find someone and settle down. Whether you find a partner or not has to do with more than just what you look like.

It seems like no matter what they do, someone's going to be there to crap all over them for it.

Even without all the social pressure, this is most definitely the case. Curly hair tends to be harder to work with; it's dry, and because of that it can tangle and break easily.

Perhaps it has something to do with religion? Like the abortion thing? I always get puzzled when Americans talk about abortion like it's a debate. Over here it's a not a topic at all.

Here's a thought: a lot of people (of either gender) are most attracted to people like themselves. There are (thankfully) lots of exceptions, but in general, you will find that many white people prefer white partners, many black people prefer black partners, and so on. Most people are basically homebodies, they steer towards what's familiar. And the internet, more than pretty much any other location, is dominated by white men (and relevant to your case, most dating profiles are from white men). So on the internet, most likely, there's a bias towards white women, statistically speaking. But again, there are *lots* of individual exceptions. And not because any one skin color or stereotype is ""less desirable"". And it doesn't reflect some kind of universal ""inherent"" trait in all of humanity.

But no, of course there's nothing ""inherently less desirable"" about black women, or about you specifically.

And you're young, if you're looking for guys your own age, they're much more obsessed about who they are, what their identity is, where they belong, than they'll be in 5 years time. And that might just make them more likely to lean towards dating people who look like themselves.",0

There are two possibilities here:
either what the two of you have is special, in which case telling her ""I can't see you again until you've broken up with your bf so we can be together"" is going to work (because what you two love each others so much that she will be willing to do this), or she is unwilling to break up with her bf, in which case she sees nothing special in you.

Huh, I didn't  notice. I haven't gone back and read all the comments - I've just been replying to whatever finds its way to my inbox and leaving it at that.

&gt;I have more issues with 1. lack of makeup 2. lack of style / fashion sense 3. Ghettoized women masculine overall behaviors, starring, mean mugging, not gentle, not nice in general, not feminine.

I've been lucky enough to grow up in neighbourhoods that have been safe and relatively comfortable...however, it seems to me that if you grow up in a ghetto, it's a rough environment and you'd learn to act tough and hard as a means of protecting yourself. If you are surrounded by gangs and drugs and guns and violence, being all soft and feminine and gentle could make you seem weak and vulnerable, an easy target. Giving off the air that you aren't someone to be messed with would be wise.

&gt;The irony of this thread being that most black women literally do not understand what being feminine means. Dressing up is part of it, a good part of it but that's not all it. Simply.. ACTING like a female.

And what *does* a ""female"" act like? I can't speak for all women, but I really despise being told that I should do this/look like that just because I'm female. Femininity is not a universal thing - each culture has its own ideas of what constitutes feminine behaviour. If it comes naturally to a woman, great. If not, there's no reason she should have to be someone she's not. 

So many aspects of what our society pushes on women as ""femininity"" is limiting - you have to have fancy hair, nails done, makeup done, clothes that are pretty but often impractical (high heeled shoes, for example), and you somehow have to manage to have big boobs and a tiny waist even if that is a physical impossibility for you. It eats up a lot of your time, it can get expensive, and there's no good reason why you should have to put so much effort into looking cute all the time. We are so much more than what we look like, but looks are a huge part of what constitutes femininity in our society. Again, if it comes naturally to a woman, great! But for the women out there who don't like makeup, have no interest in looking sexy, and feel more at home in jeans and a tee shirt, it's stifling and frustrating to be judged for just being themselves.

As for the rest, I think that everyone should be kind, polite, gentle when necessary. Those things aren't just for women - they're things that make anyone a nice person.

118762,118762,t0talnonsense,AskMen,1389594720.0,"I'm going to respond to your final comments first. I never said he shouldn't tell the husband. I agreed that she should be given a time limit, make it a week. If she hasn't told him by then, THEN the friend should step in. You admit that we know nothing about the husband, their relationship, or their household. For all we know, the husband has been pushing her away or being distant and she was looking for comfort somewhere else. Maybe she is a terrible person and just decided to cheat unprovoked. We. Don't. Know. Instantly assuming she is some terrible slut who can't be trusted is overstepping given the amount of information we were given. The entire point of the ultimatum is to give her the opportunity first, and then if she fails, further prove that she cannot be trusted. Now onto my points about how this actually impacts the relationship.



With something this serious, it's the transgressors responsibility to own up to it. Of course they don't want to. The wife was obviously having trouble already not telling the husband. Otherwise, why else would she have confided in the OP? It's troubling her. There's no doubt about it. She's probably afraid of losing her marriage, and never wanted this to happen. Giving her the ultimatum of ""you tell him or I will,"" forces her to own up to it. She can try and lie about it, but the OP knows whatever she confided in him, and *how* she confided in him. The husband will naturally be questioning of anything she says, and if the OP says something that doesn't match up with her story, he would be an idiot not to talk to her about it. Or, he may decide to ignore it. You never know. 

* The woman cheated, at least once
* She's obviously having trouble with her conscious and keeping this from him
* The husband **deserves** to hear this from his wife, and no one else.


One other thing to consider. The 2 kids they already have. Giving her the opportunity to own up to her mistakes like an adult (even if you have to give her an ultimatum to get her to do so) gives their marriage a better chance of working out, which will benefit the children in innumerable ways, assuming they can truly move beyond this moment.

I sincerely wonder if you have ever been in a serious relationship/marriage. Trust me. As someone who has had to own up to my own  serious fuck ups. It sucks. It eats at you, and it will break you down. If she really is sorry for what she's done, then it will come out when she has to tell him.",0

It reminded me of the fail ""scientific"" article that received backlash I think last year that was titled ""Why Black Women Are The Least Attractive"" or some mess like that. Then the author tried to back up his claims, which were disguised racial (probably racist) preferences, through genetics.  
  
I am so tired of this war on black women. It gets so annoying. I'm tired of racial, more often than not, racist comments that are hidden behind ""good"" intentions or ""benign"" attempts to clear matters up. It's like people are beating around the bush when it comes to matters such as these. People are refusing to see their own prejudices and fail to reflect on themselves.

Now, this next part may be an unpopular opinion, but if it were me, I would tell her she either had to get an abortion or tell the husband about the pregnancy, otherwise you will tell him.  Gives her the chance to come clean herself, because her expecting him to care for the child tells me she has no intention to abort. This gets you out of having to tell your friend. Though, it would be good to let him know after that she came to you and you told her she had to come clean, that way you don't look like you're keeping a secret. 

With no kids involved, what he doesn't know won't hurt him. But I would want to know if my wife was pregnant with another man's child. 

I can't think of anything more selfish than knowingly letting a man put time and resources into a child that isn't his. Plus, when the kid looks nothing like him or the siblings he'll figure it out. If the kid is say four or older, imagine what it will do if the child's ""daddy"" leaves. At that age, there is already a very strong bond, and the child might never recover from such hurt and abandonment. Even if the kid is only a baby, it will still grow up without a father if he bails. Who could blame him for wanting divorce after that?

TL; DR - If you can't convince her to tell him, you need to. Even if it costs you both friendships, think of what that child will have to go through when what seems like a stable home breaks up after only s few years. ",0

Among those being that they have bad genes, are lazy, are unfeminine, reject white culture (that which is feminine of course), are ""ghetto"", and just more negative stereotypical terms that are associated with black females. I can't help but laugh at this thread because it oversimplifies and overlooks a more comprehensive, and objective answer, as to why black females may be considered unattractive by their peers in American society.

&gt; Personally, for something this serious, the most important thing should be for the wronged party to know....telling the wronged party should be top priority.

I never said anything against this, and fully agree. I was speaking about *responsibility* not *importance*. Giving an ultimatum achieves the ultimate, and most important, goal of insuring the husband is told. You misunderstood my discussion about the wife's responsibility, with the importance of making sure the information is conveyed.

&gt;To ease her guilty ass conscience.

That's exactly what I said in a much harsher way.

&gt;""never wanted to happen"" doesn't mean shit at this point, it has already happened.

In context of the OP's situation, you're right. However, we also have to think about the husband. To him, it matters very much if it was a one night stand or a deliberate affair. How and why this came about are very important from the husbands perspective.

&gt;If she's willing to lie about this, what's to stop her from continuing her lie?

Nothing. But the OP knows however much he does, and she knows that. There is nothing stopping the OP from going behind her after the fact (assuming she tells him) and corroborating what the husband was told. In fact, that is an essential part of this entire plan.

&gt;We're not gonna see eye to eye on this. Yes he deserves to have his wife tell him this information,

Again, this is exactly what I said. Give both parties an opportunity to do the most right they can in a very bad situation. The husband should hear it from his wife. She should own up to her actions. They sit down and try to work it out, whatever that means for them. If this doesn't happen, the OP sets the record straight. Either way, the husband finds out. 

&gt;Why give her another opportunity to use love to cloud her husband's judgement? Because she might tell the truth? What makes this time any different?

At this point, the only thing we know about the wife is that she cheated at least once, got pregnant from that encounter, and is intending on hiding it. At no point has she attempted to cloud the husband's judgment. You are taking one very limited set of knowledge and using it to create an entire persona that could be utterly false. Work with what you know. We have no knowledge that would lead us to believe that she repeatedly lies and/or manipulates her husband.

&gt;Being married doesn't prevent an unhappy household, and getting a divorce doesn't prevent children from growing up positively.

I said, ""gives their marriage a better chance of working out.....they can **truly** move beyond this moment"" That meant positively. You're completely right in your statement, but a positive household with two parents is better for kids than a broken home.

&gt;Once again, you're still giving liars too much credit. Maybe you weren't strong enough to maintain the facade, but that doesn't mean that other liars aren't strong/willing enough to do so.

Maybe I am, but I think you are also ignoring the fact that they are married and have 2 kids. There is/was serious attachment and commitment. Without some sort of negative action on behalf of the husband, very few people just decide to up and cheat. She very likely still holds some, if not most, of her attachment to him. If she does, then it will come out. Her body language, voice inflections, etc. are all important parts of the conversation I think you are forgetting. 

It's not a matter of keeping up a facade. Everything I've said is assuming that she owns up and acts like a responsible adult; whereas the majority of your statements assumes she is a terrible, lying, masterful actress. In reality, it's probably somewhere between the two, just like it is for most people.",0

Remind her that he's probably going to find out anyway (either because of some indiscretion or other, or just because the child doesn't look like him -- or later on, when the child goes to the doctor for a blood test or whatever). With any luck you can convince her that it's better to admit this to her husband now than waiting until he finds out by himself. Even if she thinks she can keep it hidden from her husband, is she willing to lie to her own child for her entire life about something as fundamental as who their parents are?

Failing that, maybe just give her a plain ultimatum? Tell her that if she doesn't let her husband know, you will?

I would probably try to avoid tipping him off ""anonymously"" though. That's just more lies and secrecy to add to the pile. Just like your friend is going to be in trouble *when* (not if) her husband starts suspecting, it seems pretty likely that you're going to be in trouble *when* (not if) your friend learns that her husband suspects something is up.

Another angle is this: what do you want for them?
An anonymous tip or hint to the husband that ""your wife cheated on you, and is carrying someone else's baby"" is pretty much the most destructive way to break the news. If anything can ruin their marriage and hurt both of them, that is it. Is that what you want for them?

I you don't tell him at all, and keep the secret, then at least there's a *chance* they'll live happily ever after in blissful ignorance.
And if you make your friend own up, then there's a chance that they can repair the damage.
But If her husband finds out in any other way, either by you planting the seed of doubt, or by being tipped off in any other way, that's just going to add fuel to the fire. Not only was he cheated on, he had to find it out the hard way.

Won't it be better for them both (and for the child) if she admits her mistake? And if he hears the bad news from his own wife?

I don't envy your situation though. But it sounds like you're trying to do the right thing.

But IMO, imagine what's going to happen if the husband finds out on her own, or from someone else. That can only be worse than if his wife at least admits her mistake.",0

1) You DO NOT HAVE TO tell some hypothetical future partner how many people you have slept with. Clearly it is something you are worried about so IF anyone ever asked, say something like ""I think the past should be the past and I don't want it changing how you feel about me, so I would rather not say."" If says he does not care and asks again, say the same thing. If someone is willing to break up with you because you will not tell him your lifetime number he is an asshole and should fuck off.

2) To put it mildly, you clearly have very mixed feelings about all of the casual sex you are having. Not getting pregnant or STDs is the biggest deal, but this is clearly causing you a lot of guilt and you should definitely ease up on the causal sex for that reason alone. You need to figure out what you want to do and it ain't this, at least not right now. Try saying no and taking it slow, see how it feels for you.

To state the obvious, there is a huge double standard when it comes to sexual partners, so I feel for you. As a guy, I would not have thought twice about my lifetime average if I was sleeping with 3 girls a year in undergrad. That would have been great!

I think a lot of guys would be afraid of you cheating, and I've seen some statistics that the more partners a girl's had, the more likely she is to cheat, but that is probably correlation, not causation. I think a high partner count could mean that someone is experienced and knows what she wants and is less likely to cheat and more likely to be satisfied because you've already slept around enough to know what it's like. Either way, I would not judge you on the number alone. 

I agree guys might get upset that you make them wait because they want more than just a hookup whereas if you were just hooking up you would sleep with them quicker. It seems unfair; that is why I think you should hook up with everyone at the same speed, whatever speed is comfortable to you (you might require an exchange of STD test results before sex, for example), regardless of whether it's casual or relationship material. However, people change over time, so you don't have to hook up with someone as fast as the fastest hookup you've ever had. Just because you slept with someone the same week or day that you met them in the past doesn't mean it's unfair to make someone wait now.

People will have their preferences, which may or may not be, rooted in race. And this straight hair preference is something that our hair does not naturally do. So, is it our job to cater to the majority preferences especially when it costs something integral to our natural bodies? Frankly,  I don't think so.  
  
But, say if you want straight hair, for you and no one else, then I say what's stopping you? Get it. I am natural myself, and I still haven't crossed out the short cute permed hair style that that girl from John Tucker Must Die rocked. I don't like the hairstyle because it's straight, I like it because I think it's super cute.

Didn't hear from her or see her for a while, and then I heard from a friend she was admitted to the psych ward because she had cut her roommate with a pair of scissors and threatened to kill both her and herself.

EDIT: Apparently I've been using the term ""orbiter"" wrong. I mean that the friend was so much less attractive that it was obvious she was only there to make the Asian girl look more attractive.

If the OP could be sure of that, you might have a point. But don't you think the secret is going to come out sooner or later?
Maybe the husband will suspect, because the child doesn't look like him, or like their other children. Maybe he will come across a text message or email from the biological father. Or maybe the child will have some medical issue which just so happens to require a blood test or something.

Is it better for the family for this bombshell to go off when the child is 2 years old? 8 years old? 23? Would the child feel better about finding out that they've been raised on a lie?

I was in the army at the time and was about to ETS. I was an E-5 living in Hawaii making a pretty decent living. I finally got this girl to go on a date with me. It was horrible. She was on her phone, it was a Blackberry Curve so this is how old this story is and was just not interested. We had gone to a pretty expensive place too, which she chose because she didn't want to go to the place I wanted to go because of some bullshit seafood allergy. I take her back to her place and just felt like shit. For some reason I thought it was me who wasn't being interesting. She later tells me I'm too broke for her.  

Time goes by and I get this phone call. I learned my father had died. I go back home to go to his funeral. While I was there I had learned that I was going to inherit a decent amount of money. Being the single 25 year-old, put something like ""just got a shit ton of money. lets party!"" on my Facebook. But no shit, not even an hour goes by and I have this girl calling me up telling me she'll make me feel better when I get back home. I asked her why all the sudden she has called me. She reply's with ""oh, I just have been thinking a lot about you."" I tell her ""bullshit, you saw my Facebook post."" And hung up the phone on her. 

I go back to Hawaii and I start a new job as a Merchant Marine. I remember I had my first sail and I was gone maybe four months. I come back to Oahu and go to see an old friend. This guy told me that this girl that I wanted so bad has a STD and got pregnant. But not with some rich dude's kid but with a guy who was in jail. I saw her working one of three jobs at the mall. I told myself whenever I got a job that made me a lot of money then I would get a Rolex. I bought the Rolex and wore it with boardshorts and asked her if she liked it. Never in my life have I been so happy to have dodged a bullet.

tl;dr- Like everyone else I met a golddigger. I got a lot of money from my dad. She now works three jobs because Hawaii is expensive and she has a kid from a deadbeat and herpes. And I bought an expensive watch and made her watch me buy it.

background edit- I never really got along with my father. His sole motivation in life was money to the point that he alienated himself away from all his family.

Eventually, she started dating one of my roommates. While I was slightly disappointed that my chances with her were shot, she was fun to have around as a friend, both at social gatherings and just hanging around at my apartment.

Later on, things soured between her and my roommate and they broke up. By that point I had stopped seeing her as a romantic/sexual interest, and trying to date her would have been weird, anyway, given her history with my roommate. After a while, she started hanging out with us at our apartment again, but she often ended up spending the night in my roommate's room... None of us really talked about it, but we knew they had some kind of friends-with-benefits thing going on.

One day, while she was hanging out at our place, I decided I was going to walk over to the nearby Chinese buffet for dinner. She joined me, so we ate dinner together. During dinner and in the middle of a bit of a break in conversation she looked up at me and said ""So... how come you never asked me out?""

1. It is mutiliation. Function is impared because it cannot be jerked the way that it is with the foreskin. I am fairly certain that there is no way you can argue against the fact that you can't jerk it like you do with a foreskin without a foreskin.

2. More guys I know who use lotion are circumcised. I don't think you can really argue with this since it's a personal anecdote.

3. I go on to imply that if you can't jerk it without lotion because of a circumcision then function is impared.

Those are the three arguments I make. I don't make any other arguments other than injecting ideas which I say could be tested.

Let's look at what you have posted:

1. You argue that it's not mutilation because ""my penis works perfectly fine"". This is a shitty argument because 1. it's anecdotal evidence and 2. (and forgive me for assuming here) you probably never had an intact penis to use for all that long. You haven't provided any studies backing you up either. So I don't see evidence, and I don't see logic.

2. Because women don't have a foreskin that means their genital function is impared by my logic. Do I really have to tell you why this is a moronic argument?

After that you start irrelevant rambling about the function of the foreskin in an attempt to disprove my hypothesis, which is stupid because you need an experiment to disprove a hypothesis.

You appear to have failed at both empiricism and rationalism. Could you remind me how you have shown me that my ""logic and argument [have] absolutely no basis in fact.""?

This map was kind of a wake-up call for me. [India is one of the most racially intolerant countries in the world.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/) I realized that one of the reasons I hated my culture was because it was so full of hatred itself; and that I was only perpetuating the problem by isolating and hiding my heritage. I began to think that the only way to *really* not be Indian was to reject race-based measurements of worth, and I also noticed that one of the qualities I admired most in people of other races was their merit-based system of worth. True rebellion against the Indian culture, it seemed, was not achieved by imitating the racist attitudes we are frequently attributed, but rather by rejecting them for a more accepting mindset.

My motives for exploring meritocratic ideals weren't healthy- I was acting out of a desire to rebel against the people and places that made me *me*, but ironically enough, it does seem to have led to a solution. 

Last summer, I jumped at the chance to escape from my ""repulsive"" parents, and traveled out-of-state on my own for the first time, to a predominantly white region. Having grown up what local kids nicknamed ""Asia away from Asia"", the residence of most Silicon Valley engineers, I was shocked at the cultural change. 

I was a minority in the new state, often the only ""brown"" person in lecture halls of hundreds. After gaping for a bit, I realized *that was the only thing that was different about me.*

Lots of people wanted money, high-paying jobs, and a great salary. Most of them wanted a stable family, and all of their parents hoped they would settle down with ""a nice girl"" and not mess around. Tons of their parents hated homosexuals, and the racist implications of their parents (or grandparents) generation frequently still lingered with them.  Their parents, just like mine,  wanted them to listen to them, to be good, to be rich, to be hard-working. 

Some of them were short; some had high-pitched voices; and most that I talked to had never dated anyone. Some were Republicans; in fact, the most popular kid there had been attending ultra-conservative rallies since he was seven, giving speeches and helping campaign for causes like ""Global warming doesn't exist!"" or ""Gay marriage is unnatural!"" or ""Islam is too violent to be legal!"" *and he was white.*

It's not just Indians. Knowing that, and seeing it for myself, made me much more open, more confident in who I was. My situation is probably not the same as yours, but three days after I heard about (let's call the aforementioned popular kid X) X's story, I Skyped my parents and realized I missed them; I had my first kiss, and was offered sex and a relationship; I found a group of friends. 

I'm not a guy (I just noticed that, sorry... downvote if you'd like.), and I usually lurk, but this hit home for me. Sorry about the uber-long story/response.

I'm much older than he is at this point in my life, but I do remember around 30 or so is when I had my first position with my employer that had real responsibility (not just do your job sort of responsibility, but if things fuck up the company loses a ton and you're still just as fired), and the stress was a factor in my libido.  I was overweight as well, partially because of the stress and partially because my wife is a kick-ass cook - we had sex rarely (maybe once a month, sometimes every other month).

It's gotten better over the intervening years (I've lost some weight and handle stress much better due to experience), but my libido is definitely not what it was when I was 24.  That's both genetics and biology as a man, but it's also that as a race we aren't really evolved to be monogamous.  We can do it (and there are really some great benefits to doing so), but it's still a reality that our sexual evolution over human history wasn't based on long-term cohabitation - that idea, when compared to the length of human history, is relatively new indeed.

Psychologists who study this sort of thing seem to agree that sexual novelty and variety can lessen this effect over time, along with dealing with the complications that the normal, separate portions of the lives of two different people will bring over the years.  I used to fail to grasp why my elders all seemed to agree that a good marriage (and by association, a good partnership - marriage not required) is something that you had to work at, because mine was awesome in my 20s and early 30s.  However, as I've gotten older (some might say wiser, but I'm not sure I'd always agree....) I've realized that it is indeed true.  While relationships and the sexual experiences that are attached to them are usually easier for us to get and enjoy when we're younger, it gets harder as you get older, life gets more complicated, and *you* get more complicated, along with your partner.  This is where the work comes in - being more adventurous at times, and understanding at times that life will make it hard for both of you to have more sex than one or both of you desire.  I think that, as long as you're both working at it and are open and honest with each other when this sort of thing happens, such a spell should lack permanence.",0

Your father might be a douchebag (sounds like he is, at least towards women), but as a father with a daughter there's just something about anyone doing anything to her that would flip that switch.  If something along those lines happened to my son I'd probably want to do the same thing, but..... with my daughter, the reaction would be instantaneous and probably inextinguishable.  I cannot explain it, and I'd wager most men with daughters on here would agree that this would be a pretty typical reaction.  There's the rest of the women in the world, and then there's *my daughter*.  I am raising her (hopefully) to be able to be honest with me, and I'd want to know as soon as it happened.  I'd take her to the hospital, get the police involved as soon as possible afterwards, and then I'd be on the warpath.  I know it's horrible to put that in writing, but... damn.  Someone touches my daughter in an inappropriate way, and it's probably the last thing they'd do for a long time, maybe forever.  Hopefully that doesn't scare you, but it's just a father thing - if he loves you, it's likely going to be his behavior.

I'd say give your father the chance, and go to the hospital if you haven't already regardless.  Write everything down as you remember it, and if it's been less than 72 hours, it's even more important you go to the hospital as a rape kit can likely still be administered.  I agree with others who say to go to the ER first, if this is the case, as they'll notify the authorities for you - don't waste time, and don't run the risk someone gives you a hard time.

Even if your father does turn out to be a complete loser (I certainly hope he doesn't, but anything is possible), he still deserves to know, and you still deserve to not have your body violated.",0

Beers that are drunk ""ice cold"" lose a lot of their flavor because the temperature represses aromatics in the beer; any beer brand that encourages you to drink their beer that cold knows this: they want you not to actually taste their shit beer.

If you want a beer that's easier on the tongue, I recommend Shock Top. Their beers are generally sweeter, which makes them more palatable to a non-drinker. Raspberry Wheat is particularly light, while still being beer.

I would recommend for you to try some brown ales as your next step into the beer world.  If you're on the West coast, top of my list is Lost Coast's Downtown Brown; if you want something sweet they have a seasonal Raspberry Brown variant.

If you want something stronger, look for a scotch ale.  Kiltlifter and Old Chub are the two that I can find most reliably.  Be careful with that stuff, though, as it's near barley-wine strength.  You can't pound it like you can coors light.

One big thing is if you have local breweries near you.  I'm a big supporter of drinking your local brew; I'm lucky in that I have a number of local, well known breweries and can get their beer fresh.

Years later, he admitted that he actually was more attracted to bigger girls than really skinny girls.  He likes normal girls too, and the bigger girls he found attractive in porn or whatever were generally a bit smaller than me, but he actually likes it, but he felt deeply ashamed of it, because you're just not supposed to like fat girls in western culture anymore.  Everyone acts like this is how it's always been, but 5,000 years of art history tells us otherwise.  

What people find attractive is very malleable and influenced by culture.  And our culture does say ""fat is unattractive"" but for some reason some guys have been and will always be attracted to fat girls.

But sex is like giving a massage.

Everyone likes it differently, completely differently. You've got to slowly work your way up. Start gently and slowly apply more pressure until, via the ancient art of COMMUNICATING, you reach the sweet-spot and stay around there.

Some guys will like submissiveness, some guys want you to take complete command. If you start in a less... overbearing/intimidating way, you will give them (and you) an opportunity to sense if you need to start getting more... MORE... I guess??

Same principal; don't look for a knot in their shoulder blade and immediately stick your knob...bly elbow into it. Gently apply pressure and find out if they need more.

When I asked who it was, she (duh) started going off on how I did not care about her at all.  How I had used her and had not given a fuck about her feelings. 

I had not been to my country in two years.  I'd left without saying ""bye"" to some friends because I didn't really care.  They knew I was leaving, and I had already told them I'd miss them and shit. 

Apparently she had a crush on me since forever and had been upset for those two years for me not saying good bye.  To me, she was a friend and that was it.  But she needed some closure, I guess. 

Since she was being all ""you're an ass,"" I just gave up all manner of gentleness and told her, bluntly, that I'd never thought of her that way (now I knew who she was. She told me after I insisted I had no fucking idea who she was) and that I had no idea she ever felt that way. 

I even explained that I could not understand why she'd wait until I had been out of the country for two years to tell me, hold me accountable for her idiocy, and expect an explanation to something I had never given thought to. 


It was on a Friday night and I was already on a party. That also made me a bit more of an asshole.

That part of our past relationships is something I would focus on, plus the Christian doctrine that any person can be redeemed. 

Not that I am Christian. But any religion will do. Go ask an Imam, a Rabbi, a Buddhist monk or your choice of shaman. Forgiveness and nurturing is the way to internal peace if you can find it in your heart. It makes for better relationships too.

Also the reply I gave was to the original post about a one time visit, not about a longer term nurturing situation.

From what you've said, it seems like you still have strong feelings for your ex. It wouldn't be very fair to get into a serious relationship with someone else in that sort of situation. You wouldn't want someone else to do that to you, would you?

Hypothetically: If your ex of 4 1/2 years were to move back tomorrow, you'd get back together with him, correct, and leave this other guy you've been casually seeing at the side of the road? 

If the answer is yes, then consider not getting into anything serious.

The issue that curbs the potential to take the relationship further in my experience usually comes up in that ""C"" step. I'll learn a lot of cool things about a girl and what she likes to do, but I'll realize that I have virtually nothing in common with her in terms of hobbies, life goals, etc., so basically the only thing we'd have in common in a serious relationship is wanting to spend the free time we weren't spending on those other factors with each other, rather than having an interest in and wanting to do those things together as well. Personally, I suppose it doesn't help that I don't have a wide array of hobbies, either haha. 

For a lot of guys, I notice that their issue is their mindset, that they don't have the feeling that they're ""worth"" dating at that deeper level. While I do have that feeling of self worth, I just rarely meet any girls that appear to be worth the emotional commitment considering the lack of commonalities that would probably doom a relationship from the start.

The answer is the same though. Essentially what you're going to have to do is approach the guy like a man might approach a woman. Women tend to be more quiet/reserved/shy at the start of the dating game. It's not intrinsic to women, but it does seem to be the roll they're taught to play, and the guy has to be the aggressor. You're playing the guy's role. 

1 - You're going to have to muster up the courage to do the approach. You said you're fine with this, so that's good. 

2 - Find something to comment on. Their hat, their shirt, their jacket. Perhaps whatever he was talking about. 

3 - Carry out the conversation. Keep a strong frame and don't be outcome dependent. Make your intentions known. If this person is truly shy its you that's going to have to give your number out and tell him to text you. Actually, it's probably better if you get his number and text him first.

Keep in mind that most guys are not use to being approach by women and will act like a deer caught in headlights for a moment or two. Just give him a second and he'll revert to normal. This may be especially true for a shy person, so...perhaps a few more moments.

I hope this helps. /r/seduction is good for this sort of thing and will work in your context, despite being a woman. They're pretty good about respecting the women on that subreddit to. ",0

154014,154014,DukeCanada,AskMen,1389911063.0,"""ugh"" is just me thinking, I usually delete it but managed to forget this time. Is it strange? Well, from my perspective (and I recognize that this is completely subjective) as a 20+ year male that most people who like ""shy"" people (man or woman) tend to be confused about what they actually like. It's one of those terms that get's misconstrued.

Like, when a guy says he likes a ""shy"" woman, he doesn't mean he want's a woman who's bad at speaking to guys, can't carry a conversation, or tried too hard to please. He want's a woman who isn't out flirting with half the guys at the party. 

When girls say ""nice"" guy, they don't want a doormat, they wan't a guy with strong ethical morals that he stands by. Still, ""nice guy"" has been made out to mean guys who bend over backwards for women as of late. 

I'm not judging for you like men who are actually shy. If that's what you want, then by all means go for it. I just thought that what you wanted was different than what you were actually telling us. So I apologize for that. 

That being said, the advice is pretty much the same. With a reserved guy the conversation would either take off or drop right away. Why? Well if he wanted to approach you, he would. So you'd need to find something he's interested in, and then move in and start flirting. With a shy guy, well you need to approach and keep the conversation going. It's a little bit easier in that sense because the set (set = interaction) is mostly in your control. 

Edit: Yes, that sensation of being afraid to approach is referred to as approach anxiety on /r/seduction. So search for that if you're looking for advice. Ultimately the solution is that you have to be willing to be rejected, and not care that you were rejected. It takes a while, and you need to work on it, but most people get it eventually.

Yes.  Honestly unless you butcher yourself or dive right in without a bit of technique research (#1 IS DO NOT USE PRESSURE), even after your first shave you'll be able to tell a significant difference.

&gt; I am lazy and I was hoping to make shaving less of an involved process.

Might not be for you then.  On the other hand, it might turn you from thinking shaving is a time consuming unpleasant necessity, into an enjoyable little ritual.

Getting started is pretty cheap ($30-ish bucks), and replacement blades are essentially $0.02 a piece.  After the initial investment, your only costs are soap and blades.  Blades are cheap and soap lasts forever.

154416,154416,Avistew,AskMen,1389913559.0,"There is a difference between being kind and being a doormat. Being kind is a quality that cause people to respect you and that can attract someone. Being a doormat is unlikely to attract the right kind of people, and in a lot of people will cause a loss of respect, disdain, sometimes disgust.

There is also the fact that kindness is not the only thing. Now, I don't know about the relationships you're talking about specifically, but chances are they've been together for a while and the attraction has faded away. In cases like that, it's unlikely that kindness alone will make the sexual attraction come back. It's more likely that this is a dead bedroom because she just doesn't want to have sex with him anymore, and it's possible nothing at all will change that.

Also, as said above, the problem with the Nice Guy(tm) is that they're Nice in order to have sex, think they deserve it as a reward, and get bitter if they don't get it. Kindness in order to have sex is easily perceived as fake kindness. Not saying the guys you refer to are kind only for sex, of course, just that any argument of ""I'm nice but you don't have sex with me""  is likely to be perceived as a ""I'm nice for sex and not getting it!"" complaint.

Being nice to people should make you happy. If it makes you miserable, that must mean you're being nice to the wrong people, or being a doormat rather than being nice. Submission is fine in relationships that are built around it (BDSM and such) but when your partner isn't interested in that, the more you submit, the less they'll be attracted to you.

Anyway, this isn't deadbedrooms, but it seems to me in a lot of these situations, no matter what you do, your partner won't get attracted to you due to it. They'll find a reason/excuse to explain their lack of attraction, and maybe even believe it, but the truth probably just is sexual incompatibility.",1

One thing to realize is that in the 40's and 50's when I grew up, Real Men Don't Cry was a big part of what was normal for raising boys.

Second is that when I felt bad about the deaths, I had no really authentic way to express that grief. Because no practice through a lifetime of keeping up with the guys, manliness wise.

Also the conundrum of causing my SO psychic pain by showing my grief causes me to want to show stoicism.

The grief leaks out a bit at a time over the days and months following the funeral each time something happens and I would make that little tiny automatic mental note ""I gotta tell Mom about this when next I meet her - oh damn. . ""

I inadvertently got a side view at one point that looked like some blown out bacon that made me realize I was glad she kept me up by her head (surgery blood and guts really makes me queasy/woozy..even though I can watch the beginning of Saving Private Ryan with no issues). 

I know some dudes who can just be all up in the business and film it, but ...not for me. I think a dude would know up front if he's going to have issues or not. 

But if a nurse or dr tells him to sit down , even if he thinks he doesn't need to ... he needs to do it, because they don't need to handle you + a fainted husband at the same time, and they can see cues in his face that tell them ...have the man sit.

Let me lead off by saying that if there were a measure to 100% guarantee that every gun on earth would be destroyed and the technology to create them also destroyed, I'd 100% support it.

That's not going to happen.  The fact is that outlawing guns in america won't stop gun violence.  I can go on the wrong side of town and buy a handgun without a serial number in probably 20 minutes if I wanted to.

Also the fact that all this anti-gun legislation is trying to ban long-rifles is retarded.  Long guns account for &lt;10% of all gun crime in america.  I don't know the exact figure but I know it's less than that.  Probably even less than 5%.

I'm just not in favor of policies that will guarantee my denial of access to firearms, while not guaranteeing a criminal's access.  Which should be the whole point.

The definition of rape used by the FBI and most sexual assault studies erases female perpetrators and male victims, because the definition used for ""rape"" requires the perpetrator to penetrate the victim.  Simply put, a woman forcing a man to have sex without his consent is not considered ""rape"".  This definition came from feminists (ex: the influential Mary P. Koss, but it's perpetuated by countless other feminists), and used in almost every otherwise credible study on sexual assault (see the CDC study for an example).  This allows feminists to claim that 99% of men are rapists, even though that is not the case at all (when forced-envelopment IS considered rape, we see that the crime has near gender-symmety).  Additionally, almost ALL feminist-backed anti-rape campaigns only acknowledge male perpetrators and female victims, continuing the false narrative.  I would highly recommend [this blog](http://tamenwrote.wordpress.com/), which is maintained by a male victim of rape and very clearly goes over studies and incidences of male-victim erasure.  Also, see [this](http://permutationofninjas.org/post/57003274589/gender-symmetry-in-sexual-assault-an-analysis-of-the) for an analysis of the CDC NISVS study that shows gender-symmetry in rape victims while erasing male victims by using the flawed definition above.

Similar issues exist with domestic violence.  Many feminists insist that male-against-female domestic violence occurs vastly more often than the reverse, when numerous studies have shown this to be false.  Feminists have actively fought against male domestic violence shelters and resources.  Erin Pizzey, the founder of the first women's shelter (and instrumental in many other shelters), was harassed and threatened by feminists to the point where she felt it necessary to leave her country, simply because she declared that her observation that women were just as abusive as men.  Feminists pushed for the current primary aggresor laws in the Violence Against Women Act, which instruct police to arrest the larger/taller person involved in a dispute (read: the man).  See [this article](http://www.glennsacks.com/4_feminists_myths.htm) for more specific information on studies on DV.

I understand feminists want to help women, and I fully support researching and solving gender issues (regarding men or women).  I volunteer at Planned Parenthood because I see the right to abortion as an issue unique to women and I want to help that cause.  Unfortunately, the efforts of many feminists end up hurting lots of men and perpetuate the false ""women are pure and innocent and oppressed by men, who are violent predators"" stereotype.",0

I wouldn't have a problem dating a single mother even if my current situation weren't the case though.

**There's the typical deal breakers I think:** 

* Baby-daddy Drama

*I would prefer if the father of the kid had minimal if any involvement in your life. I don't mind them being involved in the kids life and activities. But aside from kid related stuff you shouldn't really interact with them.*

* Multiple Fathers of Multiple Children

*I cant say much here without being judgmental, so I'll just say I'm not interested in being part of this equation.*

* No Us Time

*There has got to be time for me and you, if you're in a situation where all your time is dedicated to your kid then there is no point in having a relationship. I'm not here to be your lean-post when you need help and not get anything in return.*

**Then there's one thing that might just be a quirk of mine:**

* I Am Not Your Babies Father

*I should not be expected to play father to someone else's kid. It may develop to a point where I feel comfortable playing that role or it may not. Maybe I like the kid or maybe I don't. There's nothing wrong either way but the expectation that me playing dad is a prerequisite is ridiculous to me.*",0

You're also naive in thinking that the guy doesn't have some secret agenda for getting back with you. That is why as guys, we nope the fuck out when we hear you're friends with your ex, because we damn well know more than you do about the situation. 

Let me give you an example. I broke up with this girl a year ago, we were together for about 8 months. She had always been in relationships where she was abused verbally and mistreated, especially with this one guy she dated for 5 years. In the beginning of our relationship one night she told me a friend was coming over, I thought nothing of it, she made it sound like it was a girl friend. She never disclosed to me at the time this friend was her ex of 5 years. It took her about 6 months to tell me. She told me they never did anything but once you lie about something like your ex coming over how am I going to trust you didn't do anything? In fact she told me he tried to get with her again.

So our relationship had naturally progressed without me knowing anything about her ex staying the night, I tried to be good to her and undo the damage of her previous ex's. She was damaged goods but I was willing to do my best to make her happy because I felt she was worth it. Towards about the 6 months mark we fought, all the time. What did we mainly fight over? Ex's. She didn't have boundaries with these guys because they didn't give a shit about her. She'd flirt with guys all the time and I couldn't stand it. She'd use this guy as a crutch every time I said I didn't like something that she was doing. She clearly had stockholm syndrome, this guy had such a grip on her. As her and I drifted apart from all our fighting she started secretly meeting with him again. ""Hanging out"" and meeting in mall parking lots. That's when I broke it off and said I'd save her the trouble of having to sneak around on me. We haven't talked since. 

So when we hear about you being friends with someone you were once romantic with, of course we don't fucking like it. Some more than others. It hardly means we're insecure it's more that we know the potential it brings to fuck us in the ass. If I hear any ounce of information that a girl is 'best friends' with her ex I end it because more times than not I'm going to end up hurt. ",0

174464,174464,SentientBagOfWater,AskMen,1390103648.0,"It's a funny thing.  Back in the day, online dating was seen as the option of last resort.  A magic bullet for the nerds, the unattractive, the unwashed and ultimately the undateable to find each other.  Over the years it seems to have become a more socially acceptable thing in most places for ""normal"" people to be involved in, though there is a little remaining stigma.

Based on my personal experience and discussion with friends, I think you've got it the wrong way around.  Men who have terrible luck/skills when it comes to ""real world dating"" seem more likely to continue having problems online.  In addition, some men who do quite well out in the world will fare surprisingly poorly when they go online.  There are others who do well in the world who continue to flourish when they go online and I haven't ever pinned down what makes the difference but I imagine it's to do with how well their positive attributes can be communicated in the profile/pic/message format.

As others have pointed out the ladies you are probably contacting on dating sites are inundated with hopeful messages which makes it more likely for you to be overlooked on criteria that just don't come up the first few times you meet someone in person.

The upshot is that I don't think you can really judge either way.  You might do well, you might struggle, but your online dating experience isn't a good predictor of how it's going to go.",0

Assuming the funeral has come and gone, here is what I want to say:

You cannot be by yourself all the time. Build a support group out of your friends, family, in-laws, and your late fiance's friends. They think the world of you. You are their hero. Lesser men would have found a way out of it and cut their losses. It might not seem that big a deal right now, but you *chose* to stay with her knowing it would be painful. And they want to support you. And they probably think by being closer to you they are somehow closer to your late fiance. They probably need you right now.

Also, find a support group. Lots of people go through this, and it can be a good opportunity to listen to other people's stories. It will help you learn you are not alone, and they will want to help you overcome what you've gone through. I think it will also help you put your grief into words, and you can better overcome some of that pain.

This is the hardest part: don't push everybody away. You might not feel up to socializing with other people, but it's so important. You may want to drown in your sorrow and spend the rest of your life thinking about how wonderful your late fiance was. It's easy to just sit alone and reflect on precious memories of you and your love, but that won't make your future better. It will make you feel hollow, attempting to relive the past. It's gone. It's a very, very hard thing to accept. But I think you have the ability to move forward.

I wish what I said will help you find your way. I wish you good luck with the future.

And also, I want to direct you to two important subreddits. The people there are very supportive, and they will help you. Try Cross-posting this question to /r/needadvice. Also, if all else fails, there is /r/suicidewatch. I think you are a very special person. The world needs more people like you. I just hope the tools I've given you can help guide your way.",0

You mentioned that before you met, he played Games for hours. Gaming is not a sign of addiction. However in his particular case it was probably the forest hiding from the trees, so now that he's not gaming as much as before his attention has turned to something else: sex. Addiction to gaming might be interpreted as something else, but when it comes to sex the inappropriateness becomes glaring. I don't know...does it makes sense? I don't think the sex is the problem, it's his reaction to it. If sex became unavailable, he could find something else  to get addicted to...the same way some struggling recovering alcoholics turn to drugs because they just need to be on something. It's compulsive.

I hope I'm wrong. We're just strangers on the internet, we don't know you guys. I would talk to him and point out that his sexual behavior is worrying. It's not supposed to affect his ability to function at work to that degree IMHO. It's not going to be easy to convince him but he might need therapy.

Keep messages short. One witty sentence/question related to her profile, plus a catchy sort of funny question that will prompt an answer if she has any sense of humor. Challenge her, don't suck up to her (e.g., ""I love that think you like!""). Spend no more than 2-3 minutes looking at a profile and writing a message. Ignore people who say you need a well-thought out long message; the reality is two-thirds of your messages will likely never be even read--they'll just be buried among dozens of others she hasn't bothered to read. All you want is to pique her interest.

Change your profile. Don't list every little thing you like. Describe yourself. Keep it short. No one reads this crap anyway.

For every 100 messages I send out, I get ~33 views, ~10 responses, and ~2-5 dates. 100 messages x 2 minutes = ~3.5 hours spread over ~10-14 days. Not bad.

2. Sorry I'm busy - This could be one of two things. She's actually busy, or flaking. In either case ask her ""Is there a better time?"". If she gives you a day, perfect. If not, it's probably just a soft rejection, in which case see point 1.

Realize that women don't want perfect out of the box.  They've been dressing up dolls and manipulating reality since they were children.  They want to construct their idea of perfect.  Why else are so many men miserable?  I mean who wants to totally dump who they are to become someone they aren't?  Look at the things which pass for women porn.  It's not looks, money, or success.  It's the big idiot they have to reform.  The guy they have to work at controlling or understanding.  The guy who drives them a little nuts.  Even the women who know they fall into the same patterns can't help themselves.  It's coded into our social DNA.

So go out there and live your life.  Develop your interests.  Join a few meetup groups and meet people.

Then I must have very poor luck for it to last the past 6 years. I appreciate the sentiment though.

I do consider not being able to expand a social circle a bad thing and here's why: When I look at the friends that I have made, it's been because of, more times than not, circumstantial living situations. Granted, my one friend is from my high school days, but I tend to make some of my best friends by being their roommate first. That's probably a very odd way to go about it, but somehow it's worked for me.

Now, human beings are social creatures and success tends to stem from those who are able to connect with other people. It's not just about success though, a generally happy and fulfilled life is usually based around the people you have relationships with, friends, family, or otherwise. A wide social spectrum also gives a person better odds at making a connection with a potential girlfriend or boyfriend depending on what you're into. Yes there is the occasional person that can be perfectly happy and content being by themselves, but they are few and far between. I think my lack of experience speaks volumes about me as a person. It's just not a desirable trait, one that most people would draw out as a red flag, and the older I get, the worse it makes me look.",0

Also you mentioned you lifted but don't look masculine, there is a fine line between /r/hardbodies and /r/fbb, at least to myself, the former is incredibly attractive, while the latter isn't (at least in my book).  

&gt;Am I stuck with feminine men unless I somehow figure out how to be feminine myself? 

Potentially, though there are individuals like myself who are switches, where we like the polar opposites, being really dominant or submissive.  So you might try looking for something along those lines at least when it comes to in the bedroom for the immediate future (assuming your sub doesn't work out, *knocks on wood*).  

Getting in touch with your feminine side would probably be healthy in the long run, and would also greatly increase the group of men you can attract.  So that might be something you would want to look into but if that just isn't you, pretending to be something you aren't can be a turn-off.",0

This is a good thing.

This is bad regardless of being a man or woman. I'm not saying anyone, regardless of gender, should be some touchy feely mushy type of person but you should know how you feel, what you want and how to go about getting it.

&gt;I am not nurturing or gentle.

You don't have to be all the time, but try to be when it's called for. Don't dismiss it as it just being how you are.

&gt;extremely competitive

Could be problematic depending on how competitive you get with your partner, how far you and he take it, and how you and he both handle it.

&gt;independent, practical and objective.

These shouldn't even be subject to question, I personally consider these positive traits in just about anyone. Just don't let pride mix with your independence to the point of  being a fault. If someone is just trying to help you out with little things or do something nice for you, odds are it is not with any sort of motive to undermine your independence.

&gt; I lift heavy.

Will vary entirely based on the guy. Personally I prefer an active gal, whether it be running, sports, lifting or whatever else. It means (to me) they're more likely to care about their health and themselves which is another positive trait. Realize that some guys will not like too much muscle on a woman, though.

When it ended we tried to stay around each other for months, but that guilt and anger affected us both, and it was difficult to move on.  Admitting to myself that we couldn't stay in contact and then sitting down to talk through that was one of the hardest things I've done in my life.  It was necessary though.

We'd talk sporadically over the last 8 or 9 years.  Usually it was a couple of emails, just checking that we were both still alive.  Midway through last year we properly got in touch, and for the first time since back then it seemed to be a positive thing for both of us.  She's moved on with her life, had other relationships over the years.  I'm sure I've grown a lot through the same time.  I've been lucky enough to rekindle one of the truest friendships I've had.  It hasn't been easy and there are moments of awkwardness.  Totally worth it.

Just for comparison, I haven't seen the girl I lived with for 3 years immediately before that since the day we went in together to close off our lease.  No idea what became of her after that, and quite frankly no interest.",0

But I just could not stay with someone if they made it clear to me they aren't having sex before marriage. I know that's your culture, I respect your right to live that way, but I want nothing to do with it. Sex is just too integral a part of a relationship to leave up to chance. Everything else about your relationship could be perfect, but if it turns out you just aren't sexually compatible you're going to have conflict.

You are right to be upset because his behavior shows that his commitment to your project and by extension friendship are low on his priorities. It may be because he is depressed or the new relationship. Regardless of his reasons your needs are important and if you are going to trust him and keep him involved he needs to show you through his actions.

No but seriously, I met my wife at a college football game.  She was sitting down at a tailgate of a friend of a friend.  

I saw her and two other girls sitting there so I sat right there in the middle of all of them and started chatting them up.  The one I happened to hit it off the best was the one who became my wife.  And she was dating someone else. 

I actually ended up dating one of the other girls that was sitting there that day, but it fizzled out after a few dates (it happens).  In the meantime my wife became single, so I invited to dinner and drinks.  We managed to hit off just as well as we did when we first met.  One of the guys sitting at the bar we went to found us so entertaining he picked up our tab. 

We became fast friends, best friends, but only friends for a while.  I think my phone bill that first month we were friends showed 12000 text messages!  I had a suspicion she liked me but I was never 100% sure until she went out with another guy on a bad date, the guy got her drunk, then she texted me to come get her and we ended up kissing that night.  

Our second anniversary was last week.

It really is that simple.  I think one key thing to notice about the mentality of guys like you vs guys like me, is that it seems like you pick the girl you want before you even know her.  Just go out and meet people, some people you'll hit it off with some people you wont.  Don't focus on one person before you really know them, remember the day I met my wife I ended up dating one of the other girls that was sitting there before I had a shot with my wife. ",0

However, my dad left my mom for the first time in February of 2002, just before I turned 12 and I didn't see him for almost a year after that. My parents eventually reconciled and got back together for a few years until February of 2008 when my dad left my mom for the second time and she told him she wanted a divorce. I admit that my mom wasn't single for the majority of my life but she did most of the raising of my sister and I so I think I kind of fit into this category while not technically fitting in at the same time.

Anyway, I feel like I have a better understanding of women with not having my dad around all the time. I don't fully understand what being a woman is like, but from what I see around me day to day and read on the internet I understand what women go through a little bit better than most guys do in that I understand that when women go out at night, by themselves especially, there is a constant thought in the back of their mind that something bad could happen, which we men don't have to deal with. 

I've often wondered if children are better off without their parent of the same sex being around or if I was a unique situation.

As far as single mothers go, they are fantastic people and I wish them all the best because I don't know if I could handle being a single dad, especially with a kid as stubborn as I am. 

As far as dating goes though, I stay away.

If you really want to try to win him over then do so but be prepared for him to move out and possibly get a restraining order (the line between winning somebody over and acting crazy enough to seem dangerous is so thin that it may not even exist, if you saw it in a romcom then it's probably a bad idea). There are more options but this is just a bad situation.

Move out if you think it's best, we can't really answer that for you.

No, the stigma is because it's dangerous. If both parties fall for each other and stay together or never develop emotions then it's fine but anything else is bad. A bad breakup results in people who hate each other living together, unrequited love ends up with what you're dealing with. Similar reasons for avoiding hooking up with people you work with.

We can't read his mind, I could probably answer it if I knew him but that's a rare skill. He could be scared that things won't work so he doesn't want to try. He may only like you as a friend but thinks you're attractive. The way you described his behavior is really conflicting, I'd say assume he isn't into you (the crush thing is a big hint and if it isn't then it would be a red flag, people who play mind games like that are not relationship material).

Some guys can't some guys can, same with girls. If you take a look at culture and the way we're socialized then you'll see some things which result in some interesting trends in how attachments form. Guys are taught to suppress most emotions and be stoic at all times, thus many of us do not form romantic attachments through physical means as we don't feel as if we're opening up to somebody that way. Instead we form attachments through shared experiences and emotions, if we can talk to you about anything, if we can express the emotions we don't show in public and be what society declares to be weak in front of you then you're loved (it may simply be strong platonic love). Girls are taught to be emotional and form deep connections, they're taught (just as we are) that male sexuality is predatory and that sex is something that happens to them, not a mutual act (part of this mentality tends to hold but not all of it). The result is that a lot of girls will either develop strong emotional connections as a result of sex or only have sex if they feel that connection. Essentially many men can be keep sex and love separate but not emotional openness and love while many women are the opposite (I'm one of the lucky ones that can do neither, the combination of my neurology and my past is not fun).

Fuck if I know, when I fall for somebody I fall hard and it kind of hurts. So far I've just waited until I get used to the pain, still waiting. I kind of miss the days when I didn't really feel, I wouldn't want to go back to it but still.

I know you said not to say it but you are stupid but that's kind of what being human is. You can follow your heart or your head (or rather be lead by one, good luck figuring out which is guiding you at any moment), they rarely agree and more often than not both are wrong.

On a positive note you also see what is going through aggrieved minds in many personal lawsuits and divorces, how hard it is to separate the possible - to - do from what is emotion and impossible to measure or work out legally. Money is a lousy way to measure things.

That said.

On the issue of sleeping in the same apartment but not the same bed as a co-worker and former lover? It seems normal enough from the point of view of non emotionally attached persons. But is also dangerous if an emotional attachment deepens asymmetrically, or jealousy intrudes , or his desire to have a friend visit for something like dalliance with another woman.

There are no rights or wrongs in this situation.

I think you also know all this, and are having difficulty with the effort and disruption with moving, dealing with everything to do with either of you leaving the shared accommodation. There is an inertia in humans to want to deal with things the way they already know and have become comfortable with. Change is risk, change is extra effort where all the effort is going elsewhere, there is discomfort and an unsettled feeling accompanying change.

You are sad because something like a permanent anchor or foundation to build from has come adrift in your physical and emotional groundwork to a solid future. But it has happened.

Continuing to sleep with (fuck) him would take an emotional detachment and treating it more like using a really advanced dildo. The words you have written suggest to me you would find that repugnant. I read that question more as a sort of wistful way of finding a glue to put Humpty back together again.

A big danger of proximity in the workforce is that it develops a feeling of intimacy and love between people engaged in some important task. The armed forces exploit this closeness during basic training to weld a unit into an emotionally engaged group of former strangers.

Work place romances usually develop from close contact in projects and sharing experiences.

The living together as roommates is a similar environment of stress and sharing that builds attachments.

Went to a party with my then-girlfriend and my then-best friend. Loads of my friends there. She's pretty comfortable so I leave her to her own devices; this was for her to meet my friends, not for me to helicopter around her. Spends most of it slightly drunk with my best friend.

Next day, I'm dumped. She says it's because I don't like screamo and horror movies (I didn't want to watch Human Centipede with her one time). I was a bit confused but shrugged it off.

Few weeks later, my best friend asks if he can talk to her. He's a colossal womaniser and has cheated with several girls in the past (which I always give him flak for), and so I get on his case a bit, and got him to promise nothing happened at the party. He says nothing, all moves on.

About three months later, I'm at another party. Drunk truth or dare, and one drunk girl asks how I feel about my bestie and ex dating. I'm confused and everyone has this 'oh shit' look. I get taken to the side and told they've been dating pretty much since I was dumped. Every single one of my 'friends' knew, but didn't tell me a bloody thing. They all say nothing happened at the party and nobody cheated, but I really can't trust anything they say.

Funny thing is, my ex-best friend tried cheating on my ex with another girl; trying to kiss her, cutting himself if she didn't date him, etc... My 'friends' deny this ever happened to her, and I get some laughs out of it. They're still dating after seven months.",0

What I find really helpful during sex, is taking only deep breaths and slowly exhaling. If that isn't enough, you should also stop moving for a couple of seconds, take some deep breaths and then continue.

When you feel like you might get over the edge you can also try squeezing your PC muscle, which is the same muscle you use while peeing to get the last of the pee out. If squeezing the muscle isn't enough, you should also combine it with deep breaths and/or stop moving for like 5 seconds.

203772,203772,CrazyPlato,AskMen,1390367406.0,"Theory 1: most redditors are so detached when it comes to sex because they haven't had sex

Theory 2: Giving advice is typically an external thing, which contradicts how counseled feels from an internal perspective (saying ""just ask her out"" when in reality it's much harder). The internet creates further distance because we have no way to personally connect with the person we give advice to. We're pretty much giving advice like the answer to a test, because to us the person we're giving it to is our computer, with no personal connection.

There's more that adds to this disconnect. Remember that most people are going to drop details when they describe their situation. This vagueness makes it harder to connect personally, and so we feel more comfortable with giving only vague advice, which tends to be those platitudes you describe.

So in summary, redditors don't get to see the face on the other side of their computer screen, so they talk like they would to their computer: straight facts, no appeal to emotion, no ""reality checks"", and without a lot of detail from the original asker no specificity in the advice.",0

I've been subjected to (in separate situations) her crying, begging, clamping down on my leg and not letting me leave her apartment, or causing a giant scene in public.

Second, and this may or may not apply to you, but you could have post nasal drip. That often contributes to bad breath. Do you often have a feeling of something in the back of your throat? Do you chronic sinus issues? If so, you can try something like a Neti Pot (Google videos of it), and perhaps pay a visit to an ENT.

207448,207448,Myuym,AskMen,1390412357.0,"&gt;A lot of guys (at least in my area) describe themselves as average and normal. To me this equates to boring and dull, wouldn't you want to be perceived as above average and super cool?

Average and normal doesn't mean boring and dull, it means they are seeing themselves as mainstream. Not a weird subculture. No weird quirks. You shouldn't see average as a grade, where they should try their best to be beyond the gray masses. you should see it as: ""there is nothing wrong with us"". 

&gt;Guys who have on their profile that they are interested in long term dating (if we assume these ones are not just looking for hook ups) just write messages with ""hey"" or ""how are you doing tonight?"" Why would they expect that girls would respond? I have absolutely nothing to say to such messages, it is just so boring!

We don't expect girls to respond, we expect them to maybe look at our profile and then decide if we look good enough. Would you type a very long (personal) introduction if they would just ignore it. Also when you get an message back from the other party that might indicate an interest, it is a change in the positions of power. If you are writing very long introductions then it could look desperate, So if you essentially start of uninterested with a ""hey"" message, then wait for those that reply, then they are kinda initiating the conversation, because the ""hey"" that is sent to 1000 girls isn't really the start. Makes you seem less desperate. 

&gt;Some tell really weird, not funny or offensive jokes in the first messages. While humour is subjective, I am talking about the ones that very few people would find funny let alone understand. (I just had one go on a tirade that dinosaurs didn't exist, that Satan put the fossils there to test our faith etc, only to turn around and say it was all a joke and that religion was dumb). It makes me think they are unintelligent, mean, rude or just really strange.

Women like to laugh. those who sent the messages are probably thinking they are hilarious. So they think ""Women like to laugh"" + ""I'm hilarious"" I got this cat in the bag.  

&gt;A lot of the pictures I see make no sense to me at all. Some guys just make no effort what so ever: obviously dirty clothes, bad lighting, blurry web cam etc. While others are downright terrifying like photo shopping the picture to look like a zombie. Why would they not want to put their best face forward so to speak?

So if I would take myself as example. I don't have a real camera. 2.0 megapix on my phone where every picture looks bad and a webcam that's build into my laptop. My possibilities for taking pictures are limited so to say. Now If I would want a picture to use somewhere I would need to use my laptop. Laptops can be moved, but I'm not gonna go around with my laptop in hand to look for the best lighting. And as a lack of camera's might have indicated I'm a complete newbie on the whole photo's thing, so I wouldn't even know what good or bad lighting is. Also If I had a blurry webcam I wouldn't know how to unblurry it.  


&gt;Then there are the seemingly never ending pictures of cars. Of all the women I have ever met, sure a few care that a guy drives a nice car, but I think only one I know of actually cares what kind of car it is. Why do guys think posting pictures of their car (sometimes that will be the only pictures they have, and it's not even a nice car so it doesn't seem like they are pandering to the superficial crowd) is something that will interest most women?

I actually don't go to datingsites, but a car can be used to measure the success and wealth of a person. And success and wealth certainly do interest women (and men too I think) especially if it's ""not done""to say pick me, I'm rich and make X dollars a year. Also wealth and success is relative. if you are really poor an ugly car might still seem good, because ugly car is better than no car. 

&gt;And finally, the pictures with other women. Are they trying to look cool and prove they are desirable to women or invoke some sense of jealousy in me? It makes me feel like they think I am too stupid to notice this attempt at manipulation.



&gt;&gt;Some men skip from relationship to relationship, never once staying single, because they always have a girl waiting in the wings. We tend to hate these guys, but it might be our fault they exist. Social psychologists at Oklahoma State University published a report in the current issue of Journal of Experimental Social Psychology on “mate poaching.” Participants in their study were shown the same picture of a moderately attractive male or female, depending on their gender, and some were told the person was in a relationship. Then, participants indicated how interested they’d be in pursuing a relationship with the person in the photo.The study found that single women were more interested in the guy when they were told he was already in a relationship. In fact, 90 percent of the women were interested in him when told he was taken, compared to 59 percent when told he was single. Men didn’t show any preference for the women as related to their relationship status, and neither did women in relationships.
“This finding indicates that single women are considerably more interested in pursuing a man who is less available to them,” reports Dr. Burkley. “This may be because a man who is attached has already shown his ability to commit and, in a sense, has been pre-screened by another woman.” Unconsciously, we’re screwing ourselves. By finding guys who are able to commit more appealing, we’re overlooking the ones who are available. Brains are useless when it comes to matters of the heart. [source](http://www.thefrisky.com/2009-08-12/mate-poaching-single-girls-are-more-interested-in-taken-men)

So the photo's with women is more a ""look I can have normal relationships with women and I even got through the pre-screening from one, I'm a safe pick""  ",0

Having looked at thousands of female profiles I tried to not make most of the common turn off mistakes.

I did not look at the guy sites by posing as a female after the first time. The guys were equally clueless.

1 I never look at ads with no pic.

So I had some good candid shots that flatter me a bit, but are honest reflections of what I normally look like. Here is me now, but I ain't shopping, but would use it if I were to go online again.     http://imgur.com/a/Ms3cH

After that I took the time to compose as honest a statement of what I am, what I like to do, the kinds of people I like to associate with.

I also try to define who might interest me, including pointing out that - let me be the judge on beauty - as long as you are reasonably sane and healthy we should be good to go. Minor handicaps included as acceptable as well as children.

I also pointed out that a straightforward 'normal' person might find me a bit too difficult to accept as I am not the usual button down older dude. I don't even own a tie or a TV for instance.

Also I pointed out that I don't have the resources to rescue some penniless woman with six kids, but at the same time I can pay my own way, and if a trip to Inner Mongolia is in their cards - go alone or buy two tickets.

I also promised a reply to anyone who wrote - so why not write if you think you are even close to a fit?

I got between 150 and 200 replies overall. And read with care and attention the same number of profiles not to mention the others I wrote to first.

As for what I became sick of reading repeatedly because it had no relevance was:

cookie cutter statements 

jeans to ball gowns

proudest achievement is my (child)

mostly blank other than the implied statement ""I am female, that should be enough""   nope, not nearly enuff, lazybones

long walks, candle lit dinners, fireside bullshit

knows how treat me like a woman  ($$$$$$$$$?)

I love to travel

Most of this is about consuming a lifestyle sold to them by some social marketing agglomerate.

I wanna know what lights your fire, what have you read? what do you do voluntarily in your own time? What do you wanna do?

If the answer includes TV, movies, bowling, and stuff like that - thanx but no thanks.

PLUS I want a face to face meeting soon (This is what is all about) because writing skill is not the way to judge a social possibility? No pen pals please.

There is also the nuva ring which my ex used. You put this in once a month, taking it out for your period. You're also allowed to take it out for a couple hours at a time. If it bothers you / her during sex, you can take it out and put it back in later. I personally never had issues with this, and only ever noticed it when I was fingering her. No issues during intercourse.

Seriously, have a read - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control

She tried a few other methods which I'm not terribly aware of as that was before I met her. She ultimately ended up on the Nuva ring. As for it being 'invasive' I really don't think it is as invasive as you might think it is. She's not a big girl by any means. Only about 5'4"", and weighs maybe 115lbs... not that physical size has anything to do with vagina size in reality. But with that said, she couldn't feel it once it was inside her. It didn't cause problems when she went to the washroom, nor was it a problem during sex for either of us. 

Anyways, as we both know, there is no 1 birth control that works for all women. I understand that someone may not want to get a shot every few months, or have an IUD implanted, but for some it's completely viable and gives them the peace of mind that they don't have to worry about anything for a while.

As for the Depo shots, I have a friend who used the injections for some time, and she was perfectly fine. Ultimately she ended up getting her tubes tied, but the injections seemed to be fine for her.

Yes.

But you are who you are, you may as well be honest about it.  

It's wrong of you to *demand* anything of a partner when it involves things being stuck in their body.  Ever.  

But if you're going to be wrong, be upfront about the fact that, and it's up to women to decide if they want to take that risk with you or not.

Many problems can be solved by simply identifying how long you need to lay low emotionally and not take your own feelings to seriously. Remember that feelings are not sacred or special in any way. What you feel does not define you. Feelings are nothing but reactions to thoughts. If you think something else then you will also feel something else.

And that's the next point. Try to identify the thoughts that make you feel insecure and inadequate. Find out what those thoughts are and in which situations you're thinking them. And then start thinking something else. You can't just stop thinking these nonconstructive thoughts, but you can deliberately and methodically replace them with more useful ones.

It will feel weird and forced at first, but slowly you can get used to modifying your own patterns like this.

PS: This might also work with other body parts, but that's for straight guys to speak to.

PPS: This is about 50/50 between a joke and a serious thought. To *get* attention you need something flashy. Use whatever you have. To *hold* attention you need to be flirty, funny, interesting, easy or ridiculously hot. The more of those the better :)",0

which happens to be identical to the ethos of those who slut shame. No, I don't think anyone needs to wait through some predetermined period of time before they can have sex in a relationship. That removes so much of the special aspect of getting intimate with someone for the first time. Would you tell me I was an idiot if on payday I told you that you should wait 3 months before you deposit/cash your check so it could be more special? This is the exact same thing. Look at this from outside the scope of all the bullshit religion and school told you about saving yourself for marriage or whatever. Sex isn't some big bad taboo thing. If you're going to declare yourself to be in an exclusive relationship, you need to be sexually compatible with the other person. Part of growing up is realizing that as long as you are safe and responsible, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having sex with as many people as you want/can. It's nobody's business but yours.

[Here's a skirt that makes me think of a little girl dressed up for a birthday or somethings](http://www.danischoice.com/product/cute-plaid-flared-mini-skirt/)

To me it seems that it became a pretty common trend in female fashion, ten-ish years ago, to go for the ""cute little-girl outfit with one or two details that contrast it with a very sexual look"". Striped tops, dotted pantyhose, red bows, cutesy cartoon print, and so on.

It makes sense. As a culture we idolize youth and we very deliberately present small children in an overly sexual way in commercials and tv shows. Hell, we could even go as far as considering if the preference for shaved pubic hair and small labia is a result of our sexual imagery becoming more and more inspired by children. Some times I just think we're taking it a bit too far.

I noticed it first time about ten years ago when I was out shopping with (for) a girl-friend of mine. I saw some really great pantyhose in a window and, before looking closer, i turned to my friend and pointed them out to her. She immediately agreed that they'd be really sexy with the rest of the things we had found. And then we both, pretty much at the same time, noticed that it was a children's clothing store. We spent the next two hours discussing if there is a feasible way to wash your brain with soap and acid :D

But yea, I've just been noticing it ever since. It's not all women's fashion that is like that. Not at all. But I still, pretty often, see young women wear clothing that seem more like it should be worn by a small girl. And it's sexy! I'm not really attracted to females myself, but it's still pretty obvious. That ""innocent little girl""-look *is* sexy. The problem is when the line becomes so blurry that it's hard to tell the difference between ""sexy"" innocence and *actual* innocence. ",0

That kind of lead me to believe that no girls were ever really attracted to me.

And to be absolutely clear: I don't think there's anything wrong, at all, with this fashion direction. I just can't imagine that it doesn't create a fair bit of confusion. I mean, we tend to react instinctively on visual cues. 

When I see a nice tight ass or a muscular back I am thinking about sex long before the analytical part of my brain is finished with processing the rest of the data. And since it has become acceptable (hell, even expected) for fucking BOYS to spend hours every day at the gym and taking every kind of supplement and/or hormone available, I've actually had a couple of experiences where I desperately try to backpedal my initial mental reaction because I don't want to feel like a fucking creep.

I honestly think it's just the reality we're living in now. Things change and we can't realistically expect to not have to change with them. Perhaps the whole ""you should not be attracted to people outside your age range"" is simply outdated, because we're no longer realistically able to tell the difference at a glance.

217030,217030,no_real_username,AskMen,1390498373.0,"Honestly, it's not that different from what women do on dating sites. trust me, it's not just guys who ""describe themselves as average/normal"", nor is it only guys who send one-word messages like ""hey"", or answer likewise, with a single word no matter what they're responding to.

And most people have a hard time viewing themselves from the outside, and considering ""how would someone else read this?"" It's easy to write something that *you* think does the job, but which just makes you look like a braindead idiot to anyone else.

But nonetheless, a few thoughts on each of those:

&gt; A lot of guys (at least in my area) describe themselves as average and normal. To me this equates to boring and dull, wouldn't you want to be perceived as above average and super cool?

""I'm modest and not full of myself""

&gt; Some tell really weird, not funny or offensive jokes in the first messages

""I'm *not* ""normal and average"". I am quirky and have a weird sense of humor and think outside the box""

&gt; A lot of the pictures I see make no sense to me at all. Some guys just make no effort what so ever: obviously dirty clothes, bad lighting, blurry web cam etc. While others are downright terrifying like photoshopping the picture to look like a zombie. Why would they not want to put their best face forward so to speak?

Lots of options for this one: ""I don't really have many pictures of myself, so here's whatever I could find"", or ""I don't have a decent camera, and I'm not going to buy one just to show you a better profile picture"", or ""I don't need to impress you with how handsome I am. If you don't find it intriguing that I photoshopped the picture to look like a zombie, then you're just a boring and unimaginative person"" (Remember what you said above about not wanting people to be ""average"". And yet you object when people put unusual photos up which clearly have a story/conversation hook attached to them? (Why did you photoshop it like that?) ;)

&gt; Then there are the seemingly never ending pictures of cars. Of all the women I have ever met, sure a few care that a guy drives a nice car

Sure, and showing ""this is my car"" is a bit more convincing than just writing in your profile ""also, I have a nice car"", don't you think? Alternatively, ""I care about my car. If you don't, then maybe my profile is not directed at you""

A fair bit of what you point out is really just people showing some of their personality, rather than erecting a fake façade to make them look like something they're not. If I think my car is extremely important and impressive, and I want to meet a girl who respects that or agrees with it, then I'll put up a picture of my car. If I have terrible personal hygiene, then why would I pretend to be newly washed and in clean clothes on my picture? Anyone to whom that matters are going to be turned off once they meet me anyway.

And honestly, you sound pretty picky. On one hand, the guy should post conventional photos and not tell weird anecdotes, stories or jokes. On the other hand, they shouldn't be normal, average, dull or boring?

Your profile is supposed to appeal to the kind of person you'd actually be a reasonable match with. Why try to impress someone who would hate you if they met you? It's possible that most of those profiles are just not intended for you. They're intended for girls who like guys who obsess about their cars, or girls who don't care that the guy can't wash his own clothes and has to be told when to shower, or girls who find it funny and charming when the guy posts a photo where he looks like a zombie.

I you find all those unappealing, then you're obviously not who they're searching for.

And even if she's not pregnant, studies have shown that women of childbearing age who are sexually active should take a prenatal that contains folate in case of unexpected pregnancy, because neural tube development in the fetus occurs before you would show a positive pregnancy test. 

If she actually is pregnant, while having a birthing plan is important (does she want meds, a water birth, home birth, etc) it will be important for her to not get too wrapped up in the plan. Very rarely does everything go as planned and some women get so dead set on the plan that when things change (think emergency c-section) they have a hard time coming to terms with it and can end up depressed or feeling guilty. Just remember that the best birth plan is the one that helps your baby to arrive safely. I had a c-section because we knew from the ultrasounds that our daughter was going to be big and she wasn't decending like she should, and it gave me peace of mind just to know that we were doing what was best for our daughter, even though it wasn't exactly what we had planned.",1

I'm sure that there are some cases of men who do attract women and are totally oblivious to it.  This might be because the signs of that attraction are subtle, or because the men are not socially calibrated to those signs, or because they have other mental processes such as depression causing them to misinterpret those signs.

When it comes down to it though, if you're living your life in what seems to be a normal way but don't receive unprompted attention from women and don't receive positive responses to your advances towards them I'm not sure how else you can interpret the situation.  It might be a nice fiction to believe that there are countless ladies whose eye you have caught but you just didn't notice, but I would argue that especially as you start to move through your teens and early 20s you're actually more likely to misinterpret in the opposite direction, to see attraction in the mildest of compliments or friendly approaches.  This is why we have ladies here saying they are worried about giving a man a friendly compliment - because if he is starved for these things he is likely to see them as romantic or sexual interest.

Add in even one or two especially spiteful rejections of your attention (even if they are not particularly personal attacks on you), a bit of ""just man up, everyone can attract *someone*"" advice, and ""I don't attract women"" easily turns into ""I will never attract women"".",0

a 20yo girl might date anywhere from an 18yo guy to a 26 yo guy. Which is to say, a 26, 27 or even 28 yo guy would date a 20 yo girl no problem.

a 20yo guy is more likely to date from 18 to maybe 22. Not that he is opposed to dating a 26yo woman, for example. But her preferences align with her pool of guys from 25 to 30something.

Because women have a larger pool in the earlier years, they have a comparatively easier time (in addition to phenomena such as having higher market value, not needing to approach but can be passive) than guys of the same age. And because those women in a guy's range will skew towards dating men their age or older, it further reduces the available women within the male pool.

Abortion - now that we have so many birth control options for women, and are on the cusp of having more options for men, there's no reason for it to happen as often as it does. It should be rare.

I cheat a little here because one corner of my bedroom acts as home office, but that currently contains a trophy I won when I was 6, a couple of items from my transformers toy collection, plaques from both my high school and my university, 3 or 4 of the more displayable souvenirs from a couple of vacations which were important to me and a small number of photographs of family and friends taken on memorable occasions.  The childhood items are balanced by other current and past interests.

The only other thing I can think of is keeping things uncluttered.  In the same way as an adult bedroom should be tidy, if whatever shelf space you have is crammed with items it will look more like storage than display.  Give each item plenty of space, don't be afraid to be brutal in your selection process.  Store the rest either to rotate out at some point, or to display elsewhere when you have other rooms to personalize.

222793,222793,Mongoosen42,AskMen,1390536974.0,"Confidence is NOT being better than other people. Confidence is knowing in your heart that you are the best you that you can be, being secure in that feeling, and so not caring if and when other people think negatively about you.

Lets use dancing as a random example. Confidence doesn't mean being a great dancer, or pretending to be a great dancer, or telling everyone what an amazing dancer you are. Confidence means not caring about what other people think about your dancing. Just dance for yourself, in whatever way that makes you happy, and if other people like it then good for them and if they think it's stupid then who cares.

When I go out to clubs I dance like a fool. And I'm pretty sure I look ridiculous. I spin in circles and flail my arms, and I look pretty ridiculous. But people actually really love it. One of the best compliments I ever received was having some girl I didn't know come up to me and say ""You dance like you are in your bedroom wearing pajamas and **no one is watching you**."" THAT is what confidence is.

So, how to be confident? Whatever you do, do it for yourself. Don't do things for other people. Don't do things to get attention. Don't do things to impress a girl or get laid. Do things for yourself, do things to make yourself happy. The way other people react to you is irrelevant.

Putting this into the practice of approaching people you don't know and starting a conversation is tricky, because we all fear rejection. The key is: don't be afraid of rejection, because it doesn't matter what they think of you. If you are trying to talk to someone at a party (guy or girl) you are not doing it to make them happy. You are doing it because what makes you happy right now is talking to people you don't know. If one of those people finds you to be a repulsive human being....well that's really too bad for them that they have so much energy invested in not liking you. Must suck to be them and spend all that time not liking you. But it doesn't affect you. You got what you wanted, which was nothing more than to talk to someone you didn't know.

However, there is a difference between mentally ill and crazy.

You should be fine.

Crazy girls are the kind who do things that are out of left field in a bad way, that are dangerous and violent and horrible and abusive. These are girls who fake pregnancies and threaten your friends.

I've dated crazy girls and mentally ill girls. Mentally ill was fine. Crazy was not.

If it's a symptom of things, it's understandable. I've been there. But, if it's just you being over-the-top, it would be a deal-breaker.

It's a horrible thing to say, I know, but there's a limit to how much illness one can take. You sound like you're stable and nice and honestly a good person, but if right off the bat you started talking to me about how you gave birth to your cats, I'd nope the fuck out of there.

It's like this.

1. You're turned on.

2. You start stroking it.

3. You don't really feel anything.

4. For a while, it's just methodic stroking.

5. Finally, you ""get into the groove"". It becomes natural, organic, you don't want to stop.

6. Cum. Cumming itself isn't incredible (It's really nice though), it's an orgasm that's good. Every now and then, and it's rare, you will be masturbating and you'll cum and it'll be like heaven opening up and an invisible shower of angelic goodness falls over you and all is right in the world.

1. Allow yourself to feel what you miss. For me this meant creating playlists of music that I knew could draw out my emotions. You want to feel heavily and you want to feel strongly so that once you've felt as much as you can feel you can reflect on your experiences with the SO. This means remembering the good things that happened and understanding why they were good (and then taking that information and using it to better yourself in your own life) and also considering the bad, what cause the relationship to end, how were you wronged etcetera.

2. Write things down. This was the part I pushed away from the longest but it is really worthwhile. Put down your feelings for this person on paper. You've allowed yourself to feel and you've reflected so now you can clearly express what you mean. For me this meant writing down why this woman was someone I loved and what she'd meant to me, and why I was hurt and angry at her for the way things ended. In a sense you're saying these things to the person without actually having the conversation, releasing the bottleneck that comes along with the emotions.

3. This one is common to everyone, but time is the largest factor. Cutting the person out of your life isn't always necessary but immediately avoid anything that will reopen old wounds. You're reflecting, you're feeling things, you haven't moved on yet, but your getting there. You're in the process of getting your mindset to the place where its ready to move on and part of this is taking time to yourself to figure out who you are. I knew I was ready when her tweets about her boyfriend no longer bothered me.

Obviously I'm a huge proponent of reflection and self-improvement and as an introvert that's really where I feel the key lies in getting over someone. Using your inner knowledge and processes to get to the heart of the matter and allow yourself to see the situation for what it really is.",0

That said, as the recipient of that message I would feel a little leery of being told my SO was in love with me so soon into a relationship. If he doesn't (yet) reciprocate those feelings (love is pretty significant!) it can make for some awkwardness between you.

If you're okay with the potential event that he hasn't moved as quickly as you have emotionally then go for it!

226409,226409,lorelei_,AskMen,1390581421.0,"&gt;I don't notice women checking me out. This is either because they're too subtle or I'm not observant enough. Probably both.

&gt;Women rarely make the first move, so it often seems as if there's a lack of interest from their part. You have to do all the work and often it feels like chasing something that doesn't want to be caught.

Both of these are very true, not just from the standpoint of how men see/feel about this - a lot of women are overly subtle when trying to flirt with men and a lot of them don't make the first move (some even downright refuse to do so). This tends to be because a lot of what women are told/taught about how to 'get' a man (in as much as it's something one acquires) tells them to be that way. Women's magazines and other forms of media spend an inordinate amount of time &amp; effort telling women that obvious flirting/making the first move will make men seem them as sluts. Hence why you get a *lot* of otherwise confident women who amp up the subtlety &amp; playing hard to get to ridiculous proportions.

Context: I should point out that I'm saying this as a woman who rarely conforms to the playing coy method of flirting with men and who has on numerous occasions been described as *very* forward because I have no qualms over approaching someone that I'm interested in directly (and who has also been bitched at for doing so rather than waiting for them to come to me). 

Also, I think that this part is a two-way street:

&gt;It takes experience to learn how to be rejected and many guys take a long time to get comfortable enough with this to put themselves out there enough for things to work.

Women also have to learn this, but tend not to bother because they assume that men will/should approach them. Getting rejected is tough for anyone, regardless of gender, but it's one of those things that becomes far less horrific over time. I think it would probably benefit men &amp; women everywhere to realise this - and to learn how not to take it personally (which is hard, but do-able).

19% of pregnancies in 2008 ended in abortion. That's *often*.  Roughly 1 in 5 is a lot. If 19.5% of babies were born blind you'd probably feel that blindness happened often.

I understand that. However, there are actually two bodies involved in an abortion - the woman's, and the fetus'. If it only affected the woman's body, I'd be all for it. Go for it! But that isn't the case. Which is why I feel strongly about it, and why I think it's an important social issue. 

&gt;That would say that we should work on education more than trying to prohibit abortion.

Completely agree. I don't understand people who are vehemently against abortion but also against sex ed in schools, or use of birth control, or social welfare programs that make it possible for young moms or poor moms to keep their babies. It's beyond stupid. You can't have one without the other! And I also agree that banning it doesn't help. Abortions will still happen. And there are situations in which it is absolutely necessary to save the mother's life...I would never support making these women die, losing both lives when one life can be spared. Banning it's a mistake. If you want to reduce it you have to address the root causes instead. 

Actually, what's cool about what you said is that it's really true - abortion statistics from places where sex ed is comprehensive and normal in schools are different than they are in, say, the Bible Belt.

If you're under 35, born human female and work out then most guys would be interested in sexing you (obviously preference varies on a personal level, but as a population, this is generally what men want). A much larger % of the female population can pull this off.

Do you have any reasons to think he's not attracted to women?) although there are definitely men who watch porn between men without having any desire or ever doing it. Some just like the ""taboo"" aspect of it, apparently.

Although yes, most of the time, people watch porn because they're sexually attracted to the people in it. Is it the only porn he watches, or the one he mostly watches? Does he never watch anything with females in it?

Honestly... it's my opinion as a female and I know you ask for men's opinions so I understand if you don't really care about mine, but in your position I would probably leave him alone. The porn he watches, in itself, isn't really my business, and it doesn't seem that your sexual or romantic life is affected here.

It might help him to see someone about being molested, but you know what? If watching that kind of porn is how he copes, well good for him. Many victims of abuse cope by committing abuse instead. He watches consensual porn and imagine it's abuse (""getting damaged"") and comparatively, that's really healthy and mature of him because nobody gets hurt, and it helps him deal with what happened to him as a boy.

Now, this being said, you did say ""teen"". If they're young enough that it's illegal, (18 and 19 are still teens, so it's unclear from just that word) then that's scarier. I think you should address that part. Just let him know that you want to support him and you love him, but if teenagers are actually getting taken advantage of in the process, that's wrong.

Definitely support him about sharing his experience as being abused with you. These things are difficult to talk about and the last thing you want is making him feel like you're judging him for it. But he needs to refrain from hurting other kids, even indirectly (consuming porn that was produced by abusing them).

I'm worried about the ""I don't have anybody"" part of your post. It's important to have friends and family to support you as you support him. I hope you will find people to help as it's not easy being alone, especially since you're raising kids and that must be exhausting.",1

Don't take offense at everything I say, unless it is play offense.  If you aren't sophisticated enough to not be offended by the ridiculously outrageous things I might joke about, don't engage me in conversation.

By the same token, don't be afraid to call me out on the stupid stuff I come up with.  Be prepared to have a rational discussion, if I pursue it.

Keep response time to a minimum.  If I text you, don't wait a day to get back to me, even if you are busy.  If I call you, answer your phone, usually I'm not going to call you because I just want to shoot the shit.

&gt; How much does the person's style of dress influence your opinion of them?

Mostly, I pity those who dress outside the norm.  They have to suffer with the stares and the looks from people who have small minds.  Sometimes, it is a little off-putting, initially.  I'd have a hard time not being distracted by a spike through the nose or the big ear-lobe stretching thingies.  Pink hair, mohawks, tatoos up the neck... it's always hard to know if that is a cry for attention or a way to ego differentiate that just went a little too far.

&gt; Would you rather a person to tell you they can't do a particular task outright, or instead at least try with probable faliure?

Try with probable failure.  And by try, I don't mean a passive aggressive half-hearted try.  I mean a full-blown-I'm-giving-110%-to-the-team-because-I-believe-You-wouldn't-have-asked-me-to-do-it-unless-I-could try.

&gt; How do I hold a conversation with you?

Sorry, I'm not going to be able to help you there.  I suck at small talk.  I'm currently enrolled in SmallTalk 099 (Remedial) at the local community college.  I can get worked up about politics and religion, but those topics should be avoided at all costs.  I'm not really into sports, but a lot of guys my age are.  I don't really care for actors and actresses.  It's a tough question.  Talking about the day's events and exploring how everything went down and why is often ok.

&gt; Is there anything that makes you lose respect or get annoyed instantly?

Dishonesty.  Disloyalty.  Constantly being late (which see: dishonesty).  Not answering the phone.  Quitting (except bad habits).  Lack of sympathy/empathy.

&gt; What actions can I take to gain your respect as an equal?

Yah.  So, I'm an older guy.  You want my respect as an equal, go to college and get a graduate degree in a field of your choosing.  And then support yourself for a while without any help from your family.  Or, pick something to do that you can make a living on and live on your own for a while, without support from parents or family.  Become an independent person, then let's talk about equality.

&gt; Would you/have you ever consider a teenage girl as your equal?

Equal in humanity and the suffering we will face, but not equal in experience, education, or capabilities.  When I was a teenaged boy, I considered teenaged girls my equals for the most part.

I am not every old phogy, so just my point of view here.

I currently have an art studio I share with mostly twenty something art students whose friends run the gamut from late teens to thirty.

I don't work very hard now, and spend time with the younger peeps chatting about what they are doing and they sometimes ask how to do something with whatever they are gonna try next.

About the ones I respect?

So we discuss, and I talk about how I solved or did not solve some issue and encourage them to let me know if what they decide to do worked out, then we strategise over how to fix it or not. On an equal to equal basis using first names.

I respect the young women if they are courteous to their peers and to me and are straightforward in their relationships and speech.

I also know from my own life that they will have lots of gaps in knowledge, the young wll also know stuff I never will know or experience.

I dislike when they start blowing smoke about how much they know, are able to - whatever. But time will teach, and it ain't my job. But I do not respect boastfulness, rash decisions where the consequences of failure are severe.

Ink, metal, polychrome hair, whatever the current style? Be what ya wanna be. Your time is now and enjoy it.

But if its gonna be ink?

Pretty phuleeze do not put some cookie cutter Disney shit on your arm or ankle. And no hooker stamps on the  base of your spine. Get a bit of decent art that will last and still look cool wen your 40 and a mom of three.

Keep the metal outta your nose. It creeps me out. Most metal is superfluous decoration of something pretty awesome in its own right.

I was one of those long haired drug crazed hippie Stones fans for god's sake. (And the Stones, Dylan and Beatles are my age) but I only wore it longish and only did the less dangerous stuff ( avoided speed, coke and heroin). And it was not several times a day, more like social.

I trained myself to get off really quickly as a teenager. I didn't have a very private room where I'd masturbate, and the fear of being discovered was always there. So I associate arousal with the need to get off quickly, and also with a sense of anxiety.

To improve the situation, I have to feel absolutely secure that the timing of my orgasm isn't important, and to be relaxed and very much in control, or very much out of control - so I can either concentrate fully on what I am doing, or relax completely. Anywhere in between and it gets tricky.

This is a problem that can be improved over time in a loving relationship. But the best thing you can do as a reaction is to shrug it off, make him feel appreciated, let him recover (it probably won't take long) and go for round two. Or get him off early on with your hands or mouth. 

I can't really answer your question about how common it is. But it will happen to all kinds of people, as it can have many causes. The causes are very unlikely to be anything to do with you, and will be something from puberty or before. A psychological issue that they haven't been able to address.",0

246934,246934,Pit_Sweat,AskMen,1390786777.0,"This comment is probably never going to get seen but here are my two cents:

You didn't give us a lot to work with. You did a great job of explaining how you feel, but what your OP basically boils down to is ""Help, I'm lonely and everyone treats me like a man and nobody hits on me and I don't know why."" But we can't really help you because in order to change, you can't be doing what you're doing now and we have no idea what it is you're doing now (although I didn't really read your additional comments).

Secondly, this whole situation is most likely not what you think it is. You're comparing your ""behind-the-scenes"" life to other people's highlight reels. What I mean is: yes, some girls do get a lot of male attention and get hit on a lot. True. But this happens a lot less often than you think. A lot of pretty girls out there are lonely too, and this is because:

Men are stupid. They do not ""go out of their way for women"" like you think they do. They *want* to, but the majority of men out there are pussies and will never act on those wants for anybody. Most guys get shot down a few times when they are young by some fake heartless bitch and they spend the rest of their lives afraid to make a move, wondering what's wrong with them.

So, the bottom line is, your results probably have more to do with *you* than with everyone around you. Your attitudes affect the world around you so much more than most people would think possible. What this means is that you can change. Of course, it's always possible that you're too ugly to be loved by anybody, but I highly, highly doubt that. I've never encountered anyone where that's the case.

I'm male, but I understand how you feel. I used to be in the same boat, when I was about 15 or 16.  
What helped this problem, was good friends. They pulled me out of the house, they make me 'come out of my shell'.  
Nobody likes someone who is extremely cocky (well, aside from people with issues of their own, but that's another topic), but confidence speaks lengths about you.  

It's entirely possible that you are just intimidating, believe it or not, guys act brave all the time, but a lot aren't.
The rules state "" Do not post pictures here looking for positive affirmation on your appearance."", but I feel this might be for a different purpose and this may be an exception. Message the mods and ask them if it is okay, if you're comfortable that is. Might help us give a better outlook on the situation.  

&gt;I've always been treated like a man. Guys always treated me like one of the guys or like I was invisible, despite me not acting like one of the guys. Girls treat me like a guy too -- acting girly and helpless around me, always asking for help, using me to dump all their feelings on, or also like I'm invisible.  


Fairly certain this is due to the way you act, not a negative thing, but as I stated before, a lot of guys find strong women intimidating. As far as girls, they probably see that you are strong and that you let them dump their feelings on you (fairly certain the latter is just a common trait among women though).  


&gt;It seems like men go out of their way for most women. They like them, love them, cherish them, care about them, want to protect them, watch them, and need them. I was never one of those women. I've seen some say they feel disposable because they are a man. I'd say that's how I feel too.

It isn't a tautology but it's true enough that girls would be better off simply showing interest and thus weeding out the ones that need the chase, one cannot be pursued forever nor can one always be giving chase but to seek and in turn be sought, that can last an eternity. As I said it is often a matter of maturity. You're 25 and likely have been relying upon being passive for a few years, that means that you were actively denying the guys who want more than a hunt when the balance tipped in their favor, they are the ones who you are most likely to stay with if only because they can stop chasing (or at least pull back as it never hurts to make the dating period last as long as the relationship even if the relationship is to last until death).",0

People enjoy being around those who are truly happy (or good enough at faking it that it seems to be real), very few people can pretend to be another and be happy. People dislike being lied to, putting on an act is inherently lying.

In terms of you feeling worthless, that's a red flag for me for multiple reasons. For one, your self of self-worth is being derived from how many partners your girlfriend had before you. If it matters to you that much (which I don't think it should, but you can't help it if it does) then I think that's the major problem here, not that she didn't tell you.

You seem to be going through some self-esteem issues which is totally normal. The therapist your pastor recommended may be a good idea for no reason other than that. 

I understand you not liking her attitude, but if I were to place myself in her shoes I would feel angry and insulted. 

She is with you for a reason though. Something about you makes her think you're more worthy of a relationship than her friends-with-benefits. That speaks really highly of you! Also in terms of feeling inadequate sexually, that can always be worked on, talk to her about it. 

My advice for you would be to understand her past shouldn't matter in terms of where you are right now. If you two are happy together there's no issue. 

I understand your concern for her ""settling"" for you compared to these super-attractive guys. But maybe they were immature or just didn't work out for her. Just because you're not super athletic or in shape doesn't mean you don't have other things to offer.

I didn't get that from the wording of your first post, sorry. If you spoke to her like it was a big deal and she just laughed you off that isn't okay. I feel she should be willing to talk about things, even if she doesn't think they are a big deal because they're a big deal to you.

250176,250176,tangonovember,AskMen,1390815126.0,"My fiancee sounds a bit like you, actually. Not the same family situation really, but she too was worried about how I would perceive her family when we started dating. She still worries anytime I see them that they'll scare me off (kind of late for that now...)

To give you some background, she's from the rural Midwest (very conservative Christian family). Her father, while a well-meaning man, is terrible with finances and has a gambling problem and managed to gamble away her college fund (luckily, she still got to go to a great college with merit-based scholarships and some loans). Her mother has a very advanced nervous system disease, so my fiancee basically took care of the rest of the family for most of her life. She and her family are still loving, but do not get along very well.

As a contrast, I'm from a very wealthy family (which cares a great deal about manners and being 'proper,' so she's terrified at family affairs that she'll do something wrong) from liberal Silicon Valley, and I was raised Jewish. Perfect match, right?

I can't speak for your boyfriend, but I can give you my own feelings about my relationship. I'll admit that, looking back on ex-girlfriends past, I do miss the 'bonus family' aspect from those relationships. I built some great bonds, both with moms and dads, and I do miss that in my current relationship.

But even when I had a great time with the family of a girlfriend...I wasn't dating the family. I was dating the girl. And really, that's the far more important part of this equation - how he and you get along. Families can be as large or as small a part of your relationship as you two want them to be.

Moreover, I have incredible respect for my fiancee and what she's accomplished without a very strong family support structure (and with having to take care of them for so many years as a child). I suspect that your boyfriend will have the same admiration for how you've come through your own trials and tribulations here. Having a less-than-perfect family history by no means makes you 'broken' or amoral or anything like that - it proves how resilient and self-motivated you are.

I wouldn't hide your family history from him, personally. It's certainly going to come out at some point if you keep dating, and you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of here. I have a feeling he won't think any differently of you after you share this - or if he does, he'll just respect you that much more.",0

251095,251095,ulvok_coven,AskMen,1390832532.0,"Mmmkay, let me explain something to you about one night stands.

One night stands are fun. There are done for fun. If the people had anything more between them than a desire to get it in, they would have dated. These are not ex-boyfriends. They are male friends who she has had sex with. Friends have sex sometimes.

I'd guess it's pretty obvious that you'd take it the wrong way, so it makes perfect sense she wouldn't tell you. Kind of shitty, but to be honest, your lack of context and your conflation of that with certain moral values would make that a risky move on her part. Obviously she doesn't feel confident, or perhaps not trusted, enough to try to explain to you the context you're missing.

Well, that, and she really doesn't need to tell you, because it really doesn't matter. Some people feel more need to be honest about that than others. I would never advise someone not to be honest about their past, but I think it should tell you about how she feels that she didn't.

Welcome to the 21st century, where sex is not sacred, and is instead very trivial. Obviously she's in a relationship with you and one would imagine she's not interested in sleeping with those guys.

As for the people in this thread saying, 'you should have your feelings!' my advice to you is get over it. Your feelings are based on past actions of hers for which you have no reference. You have to consider what her thought process is when you decide to judge her. She had sex, probably because she wanted to and for *no other reason*. She didn't tell you she had sex with these guys because it's trivial. No one is laughing at you (unless she has ridiculously bad taste in guys), they're just people she knows.",0

No company will willingly pay more in labor costs than they have to - that's the whole point of the minimum wage laws.  They are forced to pay a minimum wage - there's nothing voluntary about it.

And yes, my argument assumes that a corporation is not hiring people it doesn't absolutely need (so it has no one to fire because it needs all of its workers) and also assumes that a corporation is already charging as much for its product as the market will allow, so it can't raise its prices.

Of course companies, any company, wouldn't want to make less money.  If they could pay less per hour, they would.  That's the whole reason for minimum wage laws - to make sure they pay a minimum standard.

It's funny, everyone keeps commenting that companies will either cut their work force or increase their product's price.  I don't understand that.  Do you think companies hire more employees than they need to run their business and they can afford to cut people?  Do you think a company wouldn't charge you more for their product if they thought you would pay it?  You think they could increase their prices and don't?  

I don't find either of those scenarios to be very likely.

My brain actually shuts off when anyone over the age of 19 starts a sentence with, ""I was so drunk...""

The easiest thing to do to make friends is to find common ground. In my experience the easiest thing to use as common ground is music. Almost everyone likes music and a lot of people have a broad range of tastes so its somewhat likely that you and whomever you are talking to will have an artist or band that you both like and can carry on conversation from there.

If all else fails, ask the about themselves.

I feel like I'm a special case in this area because I went to a very small high school in a small town in rural Northern Ontario, Canada; you don't really have a choice in who you're friends are, or at least I didn't at my school (my grade 12 graduating class had ~88 students). My friends and I are somewhat different people, but we have where we grew up and different hobbies in common. Of the four of us, we all have different things that connect us to one another - for example, with my buddy Dave we both love music (namely metal), Henry Rollins and hockey and bond over those things. With one of my other buddies we bond over our hate for Apple (and love of Android/Google) as well as computers/tech and gaming (he keeps trying to get me to play LoL and I'm trying to convince him to play some MtG with me). 

The traditional ""manly"" past times are only as important as you make them. For me, I can take them or leave them depending on how I'm feeling that day.

I was liking this girl, and I was doing the moves, and when I told her my feelings she was just not up to me, and then it took me 4 months of healing. Then I moved on, and then I decided again to do the ""moves"" with another girl, you know, flirt, talk, get along, and then after some time I when to her and said how much I like her, and then she said no, just no by moving her hand with a no sign. I was devasted, we were so close, we would go to concerts, beaches, restaurants, walk on the seashore, several hours talking on the phone.

Bisexual: Sexual attraction towards males and females.

Pansexual: Sexual attraction towards all genders (male, female, genderqueer, those who do not have a gender label). They usually don't look at gender when choosing a partner.

Asexual: No sexual attraction, however one can have romantic attraction.

EDIT: I apologize for getting everyone in a bit of a tizzy. The most important point of my post was obviously unclear. What I meant to point out is that although bisexuality and pansexuality have many things in common, pansexuality has little to do with asexuality other than it being a sexual orientation.

She is studying to become a Lawayer and have plans to live in this city for long years, and I have plans about living in different parts of the planet through my whole life. You see, even having plenty of things in common: conversations, tastes, food, places of interests, same circle of friends, same church and the list could go on and on, this one thing, this one particular thing changes it all. IMHO you should not go further with this relationship, maybe just keep the friendship, who knows in the future when you face a hard time in your marriage, he will be someone who can give you advises, or be a shoulder to talk about your problems as you have this connection with him. 

If your futures will not match, you might ended up beeing miserable later in your life, regreting every bit of it.

I've had girls tell me that I have nicer hair and they're jealous of me, and a lot of dudes who used to have long hair but had to cut it have good things to say about it as well. I don't do well with women by anyone's standards, but I think that's less to do with the hair and more to do with having a fair bit of social anxiety and being oblivious to interest. I certainly get more attention now than I ever did with short hair, drunk girls occasionally want to play with it/braid it.

I mainly keep it because it's one of the few parts of my appearance I genuinely like. It's a bit of work, but when my hair is short it has a mind of it's own so short hair is almost as much work for me. I mean, no guy should have to go to the same lengths as women do to keep their hair nice, because women are constantly damaging theirs with straightening, curling, bleaching, dyeing, etc. Since you aren't fighting all of that, as long as you keep it clean and conditioned, avoid daily shampoo use, and try to let it dry first before brushing it out, long hair is easy to keep nice looking.",0

* This was not a decent response. In fact neither of you have made a decent response this whole time. If you wanted a girlfriend you should have asked her to be exclusive with you. End of story.
* No I would not GF her in your shoes. In fact, you seemed more intrigued by the sex and her money they you did about the actual girl or even the actual relationship. Seriously your line

I would recommend you now, (if you want to forget him, and move on), don't talk about him with your friends, don't listen to songs that bring memories of you two or movies. If you get yourself thinking about him, just start doing something else, watch a video, change the song, talk about some different subject.

For me I see a relationship like that lasting much longer then one based on passion. She doesn't have to be everything to me, she just has to make my life better then it would be without her.

The underlying idea behind the book is the concept that women's value as a partner drops during their life after they turn about 20. If they can't find an ideal partner by the time they are 30, their ability to keep one drops a lot and they are better off aiming lower to leave themselves with something rather then nothing.",0

Yes. I want to be with someone who is happy to be with me, not someone who's tolerating being with me. If that's what our marriage is, then it isn't the marriage I deserve.

I can see part of her premise. *Only* part of it.  I agree that some women probably need to lower their standards a little bit, but she's telling women to look at marriage as a business arrangement. Money, networking, ability to raise kids? Age the children 30 years and you have any office ever.  I *don't* want my marriage run like a business... unless said business allows my partner and I to fuck each other anywhere we want.

In all honestly though. The whole self improvement movement or whatever you want to call it is a response to the whole generation Y being gangbanged by technology. Generally speaking, there's a lot more out there to entertain and placate the average person whether it be streaming any number of TV shows on Netflix to video games, and the internet. The amount of content available these days is endless. Now, I myself, am guilty of buying into this technology coping mechanism. If I had spent half of my time in high school interacting with other kids and being involved in sports or something, maybe I wouldn't be trying to re-build my social skills 5 years later, but YMMV depending on how much you bought into it as a kid.

As a result of my apathetic approach, I was slightly overweight, lacked several social skills such as maintaining a conversation, making friends, and generally the whole dating department, and when I got to college, I got motivated to change that. Of course, years later here I am still scared shitless to invoke or escalate any kind of romantic/sexual interaction, but baby steps, I guess.

But you can see where my point is stemming from. The advent of the internet and ramping up of video games completely blindsided generation Y. Generation X had video games sure, but they for the most part lacked the story-esque escapism that most games these days have. Instead of marathoning Doom 3, they were hanging out at the mall and talking to girls, playing pickup sports, and generally figuring out what works in certain social situations and what doesn't. It's only when Gen Y grew up that they realized ""Oh shit, there's a bunch of stuff that I missed and now I have to fix it."" I'm just glad that the thing that condemned me (internet), is also the thing that holds many of the answers for people everywhere.",0
268098,268098,ImmaRussian,AskMen,1390969167.0,"They're not full of it.

It has happened. I've had girls just straight up ask me to have sex with them, and it didn't creep me out.

What creeps me out is when someone keeps trying to make something happen after they've been rejected.

I think at some level this is at the heart of ""Creepy."" If someone realizes they've been rejected and they keep trying, that tells me that they want to be with me and they aren't overly concerned with whether or not I like them. That just feels rape-y. 

Sometimes people give subtle rejections and think they're more obvious than they actually are, and if someone just misses a cue, they can easily be labelled creepy. I try to take this into account; if I've given someone a subtle rejection and they don't take the hint, that's fine; if I make it obvious for an extended period of time or state it directly and she's still very direct, that's creepy. It takes a lot to creep me out, but it has happened.

I went on a date with a girl once and made it clear that I didn't want a second date. She asked me to come to a club thing, and specifically said we should hang out again, to which I said 'I'll probably be busy for awhile', and I said I might show up to the club thing, then I didn't.

Later she complained about her printer and asked me to come over to fix it... I thought she just wasn't taking the hint, so I thought ""maybe we can still be friends, but I'm sure as Hell not going over to 'fix her printer'."" We saw each other again later at a gathering for an event and she asked me to come over to help her fix her printer... I was stuck on campus for the next hour but I didn't actually have anything to do there.

I indicated that I didn't want to go back to her dorm. She asked me if I had any classes to go to in that hour, I said no. She asked if I had anything to do, and I said ""Well no, but-"" and she said ""Well then there's no reason you can't come over, so you should come help me with my computer.""

She could clearly see that I wasn't in to her and she was still making very obvious moves, and more importantly she intentionally put me in a position that she knew would make me uncomfortable in order to get her way.

Then, at long last, I was creeped out and angry. I went to her dorm. I looked at her computer. I was *polite* but I didn't try to be sociable or nice anymore. She tried to show off her German skills while we were walking there. I interrupted and completely walked all over her with a tirade in German that she didn't understand a word of. When we got there, I asked her for hardware and software specifications on her computer, which she didn't know, diagnosed the problem, and left as soon as it was mildly polite to do so. She texted and asked me to hang out later. I did not respond.

I've been mildly creeped out before a few times, but that's the only time I've ever been completely creeped out by anyone.",0

Is he watching too much porn?
Same girl over a long time can affect performance.
Too much stress?
Not confident?
Licking you is bound to have a mental aspect that he enjoys, it might be his way of warming up. Also a physical transfer of chemicals that act as an aphrodisiac.

Some things that could help.
More kissing from you (also an aphrodisiac).
Foreplay concentrated on him and how sexy you feel he is to boost a bit of ego and make him feel confident.
Get him to try meditating or relax sometime in case he is too stressed.
Give him a massage that slowly gets more sexual.
More talking dirty about yourself rather than him.
Dress provocatively (this you might need to ask about to find what gets his D hard).

69!!!!!!! Seriously it's the perfect way to push him from just getting hard to wanting to fuck, while he can do something he obviously enjoys.

No porn, masturbating or even sex for a week. NO touching. Don't even look at a naked body. (Don't make it a requirement, just something to try ""because you heard guys that do it have huge loads of cum afterwards and you love that"". Even if you don't.)

Take a look at this study:

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-09/study-hard-to-find-if-harvard-pays-off-commentary-by-laurence-kotlikoff.html

If you start working now and don't drink your money away at the local bar every night, you can be a very wealthy man. 

Plus you'll probably be happier than getting some know-nothing degree from a community college or state university that shovels you right into a shitty sales job in corporate america where your soul is sucked away from you every day.

Go to work, save your money, pat yourself on the back when your college educated friends complain about their student loan debt and their shitty job that isn't even related to what they studied.

Edit: The meat from the study

&gt;Consider four equally talented 18 year- olds -- Joe, Jill, Sue, and Matt. 

&gt;Jill chooses medicine. Sue and Matt both get bachelor’s degrees in education at the same expensive college Jill attends, but Matt spends an extra two years after college getting his masters. Joe takes a pass on attending college. Instead, he decides to become a plumber.

&gt;Jill, the doctor, has the highest living standard. She gets to spend $33,666 year in and year out from age 19 through 100.

&gt;Joe the plumber’s sustainable spending is almost as high -- $33,243

&gt;Sue, the teacher? Sue has less spending power -- $27,608 -- than Joe.

&gt;Matt, with his masters? His spending power is even lower than Sue’s, at $26,503.

&gt;All those grueling years of study, exams, late-night emergency calls, and Jill gets to spend a measly $423 more per year than a plumber.",0

She has a boyfriend and she's hitting on you. Does that sound like she's worth your time? Because if she's doing this to him, what makes you think she won't do it to her? Even if she breaks up with him, her behaviour is showing you what kind of girlfriend you can expect her to be. If her solution to dating the wrong man is to cheat on him instead of doing the adult thing and ending it so she can be with someone else, she's not girlfriend material! She's too immature and/or selfish to be in any kind of lasting relationship...it would be a waste of time.

If you go for it, you will be pretty much as crappy as she is - you know she's taken, you know it's wrong, and if you do it anyway. I hope you are better than that, because it's a selfish and dishonourable thing to do. The fact that you've had the hots for her since high school is totally irrelevant. It would still be a lousy thing for you to do. 

If you hang back and wait and she breaks up with him, you're going to be dating a woman who pursues other men while dating, and that's not going to be a lasting, happy relationship, now is it?

If you tell him, one of two things will happen: he gets angry and assumes you're lying and there's a big fight; or he believes you, dumps her, and then you may lose her friendship because she will blame you for the demise of the relationship even though *she* is to blame. 

If it was you, and your girlfriend was hitting hard on another man behind your back, what would you want him to do? Bang her, because he's wanted her for so long and feels like he doesn't owe you anything? Encourage her to ditch you so they could be together? Tell you, so you could cut the cheater free and find a woman you can trust? Whatever you would want another man to do in your situation, with *your* girlfriend, that's what you should do. Personally I'd go with telling him...he deserves to know the truth and there's probably no way she'd ever tell him.",1

It happened to me last year, really similar to you but in a shorter time. We used to do the same things as you did, our story is basically the same but the friendship lasted 1 year, it took me 6 months to tell her my feelings but she was just not into it, she did not have the same feelings. I gave it a break, and I step away, I stopped calling, hanging out etc, and then she called me two weeks after I told her my feelings, and she said if we could continue our friendship because it was something that she did not want to loose, and being friends with me is all that she wants and she enjoys being with me. So I tried to make things work again, but it just got weird, we would hang out, but it would be different, she would talk less so do I, and then she SMSed me telling that she was moving to another state, after months we would talk less and less, and as for this day, it's been 2 months we do not say a word to each other. Last week I saw her facebook page been updated, she is now in a serious relationship with another guy. So I guess that's it, it was just not meant to be.

You steping away might make her think a bit, wait if she will get in touch back with you, if she really values the connection you two have, she will call you back. But there will be up to you if you will be able to handle things, I just could not look at her and just be friends, the only thought that would come to my mind is a more serious relationship, but by knowing she was not up to it, it would break my heart constantly so it was better for me and for her for us to end the friendship.",0

It is easy for many women (and some men) to find a partner to have nsa sex with.

So I think it comes down to the situation -- if the potential cheater wants to have sex with you specifically, but wouldn't cheat with someone else, or if they couldn't easily find someone else to cheat with, then you are causing more cheating to happen than would have without your participation.
But otherwise it doesn't make a difference.

In practice, though, I agree that it's almost always wrong, because since the cheater is actually trying to sleep with you instead of someone else, they obviously at least somewhat prefer sleeping with you to any alternatives.
It would be quite the coincidence if they were *exactly* indifferent between you and someone else and just chose you at random.

But on the other hand, there are degrees of wrongness, I think. 
If cheating would be a little less likely to occur if you didn't participate, doing so is less wrong than when it would be much less likely. ",0

To some extent it also depends on where the fat sits on your face, if it goes to your cheeks your face can still be attractive in a sort of babyfaced way.

The ones that you're actually attracted to are the monority that AREN'T desperate to be asked out (though they still probably appreciate it).

I feel like you're using the ""You're not a real man"" definition of ""needy"" and ""desperate"". You know, the one where a man should just shut up and deal with any problems he has, like a Real Man™.

There are plenty of guys who are quite capable of taking care of themselves, who are confident (but not cocky), who can get laid if they choose to go out and chase women et cetera who still think it would be nice if women put a bit more effort into pursuing men.

Also, my experience, which is of course highly anecdotal, is that most women **will** pursue a man if they think he's the best available option. The difference between men and women being that if a guy realizes that his #1 choice (at a glance, as in, just got to the party and noticed her) is out of reach (e.g. she's clearly interested in some other guy or several other guys are trying to hit on her) he'll move on to #2, then #3 and so on until no women who meet his standards are available while many women seem to go ""Huh, well, guess I'm done here"" after the first guy (when talking to female friends about this in the past the responses I got gave me the impression that most of them had a ""never settle for anything but the best"" attitude, which is kind of odd when you consider that the same women would then **settle** for the best available guy who approached them (as opposed to the second best out of all available guys)).",0

I can't set tthings up in the kitchen how I'd like, leave my daughter bath toys in the tub like I would do so if I lived alone.

Other than that, which is a pass, I think you're justified in your feelings about this situation. I briefly dated a self-proclaimed ""very flirty and overly friendly"" girl, but I quickly found that to be her excuse for being an insecure attention whore who could accuse guys of being overly jealous when they called her out on it (she complained of her exes getting jealous at bars and the like). The key here is to determine how she acts when YOU are around these other guys. If she is giving you the cold shoulder while flirting with them, she ain't worth it.

Regarding Johnboy, he gets a pass in regards to the concert. Hell, I've had trouble finding people to go to shows with me, and pretty much anyone who is willing to go is cool in my book. However, Johnboy doesn't get a pass when it comes to ""Her"".

I don't know how serious/exclusive y'all are after 4 months, but there is a fine line between having male friendships and male affection, and I think she's crossed it.

At 30 I chose to look for a job and move back to my home state. 

I got the job offer before I sold my house so I decided to move in with my mom and start work.

My mom and I had a great relationship but I was an adult male and she was my mother. Even so she could not stop being my mother and this led to her treating me like I was still her responsibility and we regressed to almost a high school-parent relationship.

Case and point where I realized this was severely unhealthy:
I went for a run in the old neighborhood. No big deal. It was hot and in the summer so I went out around 5pm. Running through the old hood I saw a friend of mine's dad who I hadn't seen in a long time so I stopped to chat. I had nowhere to be, am an adult, in a well lit safe neighborhood.

After about an hour of catching up and leisurely running around a car pulls up and starts flashing cop lights. 
And I'm like, are you serious? I realize I'm a dude running around in wonder-bread retirey land but do I look that suspicious? 

Turned out to be my brother ( a warden.. guess they need lights), who my mother had called to come comb the neighborhood for me because I was gone for so long (in this case an hour &amp; change), ""you could have been hit by a car...you could have been mugged, etc"". 

My mom was freaked out, my brother inconvenienced , and I was humiliated and emasculated. But I knew she was my mom and whether I was 30 or 50 she'd be obliged to worry if she always was inadvertently aware of my plans and something set off her mom warning lights.

So because I worried about my impact on her health (in her early 70s, already had a triple bypass) I started making sure I kept her up to date on my every move. In h.s. it was because it was the rule, now it was just because I worried about her...but the end result is the same.

Also at the time I was single. And the stigmata, no matter how legit, of a guy living with his parents is that you are a loser. 

And if a girl can see past it: it still puts any potential romantic interest in a position of meeting your parents WAY TOO FREAKING EARLY in a relationship and can send mixed signals ....just because of your living situation. 

Another thing I noticed is how WAY TOO COMFORTABLE I had become with ma occasionally doing my laundry and cooking dinner regularly. A lot of time I spent sitting around and watching tv with her. It takes the place of a lot of activities you spend with friends or dating.

It took my house 3 months to sell and as soon as the paperwork was in I had put my 1st months rent in on an apartment.

After I moved out I still went over to her house for dinner  and to watch some TV (had a standing day once a week). The dynamic was better and more normal for an adult male and his mother once I had moved out. 
One of the reasons I moved back was to spend time with her as she was aging and had health issues. She passed a few years back...so I never regretted my decision to leave the big city to return, just wish I could have done it without having to put her and me in a weird spot for 3 months.

Why is it his friend and not you? Could be due to one of several reasons. He may feel more comfortable with his friend and more able to open up about what's bothering him (especially if it's somehow related to you or your relationship. It may be because he knows his friend shares his interests in TV and games, so he's a natural partner for these activities.

I do think you're overreacting, unless you feel he is not communicating with you at all. That's an issue in and of itself. If you're just upset that you're not #1 on his list of who to vent to when he's down, I don't think there's much to do here. Just let him know that you're always happy to listen or watch TV and play games if he wants to have a quiet evening and vent or get a load off his chest, and leave it at that. He may take you up on the offer sometime, or he may keep using his friend as this outlet.

My fiancée does something similar with her best friend (they watch girly TV/movies and drink wine) and it doesn't bother me.

I've read about you having a rough week, hang in there buddy it will get better! btw just a small tip since you have problem getting the energy to do stuff, go for a walk (Not a run!) just walk through the weather and try to enjoy stuff, while walking try to have a smile on your face not only does it make you feel better, it will also make other people a bit more happy which in return makes you feel happy about making other people happy, its like a reversed vicious cirkle!

I was having drinks with my friend outside of a bar called Capones in Ft. Lauderdale after work one friday. Enjoying the cool night air, checking out the girls in short skirts.

All of a sudden two guys come barreling out of the front doors, rocket between our table and the next (empty) one and end up rolling in the street beating the living shit out of each other. 

After a short few seconds, one gets an advantage and is straddling the other dude and just hammering him in the face with closed fists (Trayvon style).

This is all happening within like 7-10 seconds at this point.

My friend Mike and I are just starting to react to this situation going on no more than 6 feet away from us when...


Holy shit! A third guy come rocketing out of the bar with a beer bottle in one hand. He charges to the fight and smashes the shit out the bottle over the guy's head who had the advantage. Then he just runs off and disappears into the throngs of people constituting Ft. Lauderdale nightlife.

Guy who just got his head bottled is bleeding all over the place but still beating the living shit out of the guy on the ground.

Police are arriving about now (10-20 seconds) after fight started.

The first cop pulls his tazer out and inexplicably tazes the guy on the ground first. This completely incapacitates the dude and whatever defending he was doing before, now he's helpless.

The guy on top doesn't mind kicking a man when he's down and he keeps swinging for the fences.

Finally, after the tazed guy takes like 5-6 more serious hits, another cop gets close enough and tazes the other dude. No sign of crazy running bottle-hitting guy.

Everyone gets cuffed and led away. Probably to get some statements and go to the hospital before at least one went to jail.

If you only see a doctor when you are sick, the doc has no baseline data to see what is abnormal for you, instead the doc needs to compare with the generic male of your age.

Second, you are not gonna be as well followed and risk being in the long lineup when you do wanna be looked after because doctor's practices tend to grow to the limit of their ability to see patients. You don't wanna be the one who can't be squeezed in.

Also if you need something a GP does not treat - your GP is the doorway to the specialist world where they demand a referral from a GP before seeing you.

I mentioned a little twinge at my last semi annual visit, and I am off for x-rays at my convenience next week for a minor problem, to find out if really is something, and can something be done before it gets major.

All these visits to the doc (annual mostly) have kept me alive to 70 now and I am in great shape with plenty o miles to go.

And no it isn't free. I pay taxes, and the cost comes outta my taxes. So I try to use the system responsibly.

It is cheaper and better to catch stuff before it gets major. That needs monitoring.

My own theory is that the cost of monitoring is what discourages Americans from seeing a doc regularly, and they have an average of 2 years less life span than Canadians.",0

No, grow up and start thinking about this realistically.  Fight the fight that can be won, not the one you'll feel better for dying in.

Calling me a loser is pathetic.  There are no grounds for it, and you're just as bad as those people you're riling against.

$92,000 is in my house after deducting the mortgage (and valued based on when I bought in early 2012), which was paid for by money originally set aside by both my parents and myself in my name for my college/graduate education (both were free due to fellowships I was able to land--and my willingness to base my education decisions on money).

The other $90,000 is divided between my ROTH and 401k, the former of which was where most of my money went from working odd jobs as a kid.  Dad had a good program in place for me: for every dollar I put in the ROTH, he'd put a dollar into my college investment account.
